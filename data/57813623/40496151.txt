Infinity Blade III was an action role playing video game for iOS developed by Chair Entertainment and Epic Games It was the third game in the Infinity Blade series It was released on the App Store on September The main characters of the game are Siris and Isa The game was removed from the App Store on December alongside Infinity Blade and Infinity Blade II due to difficulties in updating the game for newer hardware with no plans for re release This app is no longer downloadable on one s purchased history as of August due to Apple having terminated Epic Games developer account on that date Gameplay Combat in the game is similar to the first two installments The player controls their character s actions by swiping and tapping the screen Players can avoid attacks by dodging blocking with shields or heavy weapons or parrying the attack by swiping in the opposite direction of the attack All three options can temporarily stun the enemy after a string of successful defenses allowing the player to attack A player can also use a super attack to trigger a quick time event based on the equipped weapon class that is guaranteed to stun the enemy The last way for the player to do damage is through magic spells which are performed by drawing certain symbols on the screen The player can choose between two characters Isa a woman who focuses on magic and a bracer for defense and Siris a man who focuses on physical fighting and uses a shield Both characters have access to three different classes of weapons light heavy dual helmets armor rings and bracer shields Light weapons usually swords allow the player character to use the equipped shield bracer to block and are balanced between defence speed and attack Heavy weapons such as spears and axes focus on blocking as the primary defensive option and a slow but powerful attack Dual weapons such as dual swords or daggers focus on dodging as the primary defensive option and have a fast but weak attack Helmets and armor affect the player s stats dodging ability and health Rings decide the type and strength of the player s magic spells Shields decide both the number of block points and elemental resistances The player s equipment can have gems slotted into them which confer boosts such as stat increases in battle effects and elemental damage and resistance The player earns points by leveling up and mastering their equipment to boost the player s stats which in turn give perks at certain milestones The overworld has changed from the previous two titles The player begins in a hub world the Hideout where one can find the Training Golem Potions Master Blacksmith Gem Cutter and Merchant the last three of which need to be unlocked through gameplay For adventuring instead of a single large world with multiple paths like in the previous installments the player travels to different locations from a world map Each location is a distinct map that is unlocked through gameplay but each usually only has a single linear path and some associated quests Plot In the introduction the Worker of Secrets narrates about his immortal creations the Deathless and the wrath they bestowed on humanity He forges the Infinity
