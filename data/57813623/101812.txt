A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that have been developed either internally by the publisher or externally by a video game developer They often finance the development sometimes by paying a video game developer the publisher calls this external development and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio The large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies or larger video game publishers to distribute the games they publish Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any licenses that are used by the game paying for localization layout printing and possibly the writing of the user manual and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design Some large publishers with vertical structure also own publishing subsidiaries labels Large publishers also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality Because the publisher often finances development they usually try to manage development risk along with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the developer s progress critique ongoing development and assist as necessary Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development called milestones Business risks Video game publishing is associated with high risk The Christmas selling season accounts for a highly significant portion of industry sales leading to a concentrated influx of high quality competition every year in every game category all in the fourth quarter of the year Product slippage is common due to the uncertain schedules of software development Most publishers have suffered a false launch in which the development staff assures the company that game development will be completed by a certain date and a marketing launch is planned around that date including advertising commitments and then after all the advertising is paid for the development staff announces that the game will slip and will actually be ready several months later than originally intended When the game finally appears the effects among consumers of the marketing launch the excitement and buzz over the release of the game fueling consumers intent to purchase have dissipated and lackluster interest leads to weak sales An example of this is the PSP version of Spider Man These problems are compounded if the game is supposed to ship for the Christmas selling season but actually slips into the subsequent year Some developers notably id and Epic have alleviated this problem by simply saying that a given game will be released when it s done only announcing a definite date once the game is released to manufacturing However this sometimes can be problematic as well as seen with Duke Nukem Forever The industry has become more hit driven over the past decade Consumers buy the game that s best marketed but not necessarily of the highest quality therefore buying fewer other games in that genre This has led to much larger game development budgets as every game publisher tries to ensure that its game is number in its category It also caused publishers to on occasion force developers to focus on sequels of successful franchises instead of exploring original IP some publishers such as Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts have both attracted criticism for acquiring studios with original games and assigning them to support roles in more mainstream franchises Current generation consoles have more advanced graphic capabilities than previous consoles Taking advantage of those capabilities requires a larger team size than games on earlier simpler consoles In order to compete with the best games on these consoles there are more characters to animate all characters must be modeled with a higher level of detail more textures must be created the entire art pipeline must be made more complex to allow the creation of normal maps and more complex programming code is required to simulate physics in the game world and to render everything as precisely and quickly as possible On this generation of consoles games commonly require budgets of US million to million Activision s Spider Man for example cost US million to develop not counting the cost of marketing and sales Every game financed is then a large gamble and pressure to succeed is high Contrasting with the big budget titles increased expense of front line console games is the casual game market in which smaller simpler games are published for PCs and as downloadable console games Also Nintendo s Wii console though debuting in the same generation as the PlayStation and the Xbox requires a smaller development budget as innovation on the Wii is centered around the use of the Wii Remote and not around the graphics pipeline When publishing for game consoles game publishers take on the burden of a great deal of inventory risk All significant console manufacturers since Nintendo with its NES have monopolized the manufacture of every game made for their console and have required all publishers to pay a royalty for every game so manufactured This royalty must be paid at the time of manufacturing as opposed to royalty payments in almost all other industries where royalties are paid upon actual sales of the product and importantly are payable for games that did not sell to a consumer So if a game publisher orders one million copies of its game but half of them do not sell the publisher has already paid the full console manufacturer royalty on one million copies of the game and has to absorb that cost Types of game publishers AAA game publishers produce and create games that are high budget and

mixed performance At present Electronic Arts is the only third party publisher present in the S P diversified list of large U S corporations in April it entered the Fortune for the first time Hype over video game publisher stocks has been breathless at two points In the early s the introduction of CD ROM computer drives caused hype about a multimedia revolution that would bring interactive entertainment to the masses Several Hollywood movie studios formed interactive divisions to profit in this allegedly booming new media Most of these divisions later folded after expensively producing several games that were heavy in full motion video content but light in the quality of gameplay In the United States revenue from the sales of video and computer games exceeded revenue from film box office receipts for the first time in the dot com days of the late s when technology companies in general were surrounded by hype The video game publishers did not however experience the same level of rise in stock prices that many dot com companies saw This was probably because video game publishing was seen as a more mature industry whose prospects were fairly well understood as opposed to the typical exciting dot com business model with unknown but possibly sky high prospects While many technology stocks were eventually destroyed in the dot com crash in the early s the stock prices of the video game publishers recovered as a group several of the larger publishers such as EA and Take Two Interactive achieved historical highs in the mid s Publishers List of largest video game companies
