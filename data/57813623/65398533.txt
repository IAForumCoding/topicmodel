Game Awards the show was hosted and produced by Canadian games journalist Geoff Keighley He returned as an executive producer alongside Kimmie Kim and Richard Preuss and LeRoy Bennett returned as director and creative director respectively Sydnee Goodman returned as host of the preshow Due to the COVID pandemic Keighley did not want to host a normal ceremony Not wanting to take a hiatus and inspired by the success of Summer Game Fest he considered hosting from his home but his board urged him to attempt a larger show on par with previous years In case of a significant surge of COVID cases in California the crew had several back up plans including broadcasting from Keighley s house He worked with his partners to develop a virtual show he and his team took inspiration from other shows throughout the year including the Democratic National Convention in which the audience was featured on virtual screens as well as the nd Primetime Emmy Awards wherein the hosts were isolated on stage and the winners accepted via video call The presentation used three soundstages in Los Angeles London and Tokyo each had minimal attendees mostly related to production crew and presenters Keighley said this allowed them to include additional presentation events as with past shows as well as explore taking future shows to different venues The show featuring a production of more than people six of whom are full time employees had a budget of under US million and was the most expensive to date partly due to the COVID tests required for the crew and the worldwide remote camera set ups It remained profitable due to revenue from advertisers and sponsors as well as minor earnings from streaming services The show s theme was strength and comfort due to the impact of the pandemic Keighley wanted to implore the theme of unity given the release of the PlayStation and Xbox Series X S in November he cited The Game Awards as an example of this theme which had led with Nintendo s Reggie Fils Aim Microsoft s Phil Spencer and Sony s Shawn Layden sharing the stage Keighley felt the inclusion of film and television stars was an interesting way to show a wider appreciation for the industry His team wanted to include Henry Cavill in the show but he was busy working on The Witcher While developing the show Keighley spoke to hundreds of viewers via Zoom to discuss their own interests often alongside industry figures like Valve Corporation president Gabe Newell and Epic Games creative director Donald Mustard As with the previous show the presentation ran alongside the

Marvel s Spider Man Miles Morales as well as Pok mon Sword and Shield which was eligible for both the and awards but was unrecognized in both He felt Ghost of Tsushima was more deserving of a Best Score and Music nomination than Doom Eternal Den of Geek s Matthew Byrd similarly lamented the lack of recognition for Demon s Souls and Marvel s Spider Man Miles Morales Kat Bailey of USgamer questioned Doom Eternal s nomination for Game of the Year describing it as messy unfocused and well just not as good as its predecessor Kotaku Australia s Alex Walker similarly found the nomination misplaced and considered games like Half Life Alyx and Microsoft Flight Simulator more deserving Ceremony The show received a mixed reception from media publications VentureBeat s Dean Takahashi praised the ceremony particularly applauding its celebration of diverse games such as The Last of Us Part II and Tell Me Why as well as the varied and interesting new game announcements Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times felt the show should have allowed more time for the developers to speak and discuss their artistic visions behind the games noting the presentation does little to demonstrate video games as art Eurogamer s Martin Robinson said the show was understandably low key but called it a three hour long advert Inverse s Ana Diaz criticized the rapid announcement of winners between premieres and during the preshow preventing developers from accepting the awards and its focus on Hollywood actors over game creators Similar to concerns over Death Stranding s predominance in the nominations and ceremony for the awards due to its creator Hideo Kojima s friendship with Keighley some viewers shared concerns related to The Last of Us Part II at the awards both for its awards success and due to the developer s crunch practices The Last of Us Part II was well received at release but narrative elements polarized some critics and players and the game had been subject to review bombing Keighley clarified the awards were not rigged in the manner some viewers had suggested and there was no influence of Naughty Dog or its staff on the award selection citing the game s popularity among players and media alike as proven by its runner up placement in the Player s Voice award Kotaku s Ian Walker criticized the game s Best Game Direction win noting Hades should have won due to developer Supergiant Games s less demanding work culture TheGamer s Peter Glagowski similarly felt the game s awards were a message excusing crunch culture in game development Keighley felt it would be difficult to incorporate criteria related to games developed under poor industry practices like crunch into the awards selection process without becoming a slippery slope but believes discussions of these practices should be a conversation held by the larger community Viewership Over million streams were used to view the ceremony the most in the show s history to date with million concurrent viewers at its peak On Twitch the show had over million concurrent viewers more than double the previous year with creators co streaming the ceremony On YouTube live viewership increased percent over the previous year In total live hours viewed increased by over percent across Facebook Gaming Twitch and YouTube The show trended worldwide on Twitter with a percent increase in conversation from the previous year while usage of the hashtag TheGameAwards increased percent Keighley expressed his surprise by the consistent growth of the show over the years but confessed it has led him to fear that year where it doesn t grow There s going to be a year where we don t have the same viewers Notes References External links Official website
