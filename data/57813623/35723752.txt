ing user engagement including continued investments into new first party games and other online services for PS We will use the next three years to prepare the next step to crouch down so that we can jump higher in the future Kodera added in an interview with the press the following day Following the launch of the PlayStation in November Sony discontinued production in Japan of all but the GB Slim model of the PlayStation on January with the standard PS and PS Pro still being produced for western markets According to a report from Bloomberg News in January Sony had been poised to discontinue the PlayStation at the end of in favor of the PlayStation but due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage that made it difficult for Sony to keep up with PlayStation demand the company instead planned to continue PlayStation production Besides helping to offset the PlayStation shortage this production method would help assure deals with its component providers for the PlayStation Hardware The technology in the PlayStation is similar to the hardware found in modern personal computers This familiarity is designed to make it easier and less expensive for game studios to develop games for the PS Technical specifications The PlayStation uses an Accelerated Processing Unit APU developed by AMD in cooperation with Sony It combines a central processing unit CPU and graphics processing unit GPU as well as other components such as a memory controller and video decoder The CPU consists of two nm quad core Jaguar modules totaling bit x cores of which are available for game developers to use The GPU consists of compute units to produce a theoretical peak performance of TFLOPS The system s GDDR memory is capable of running at a maximum clock frequency of GHz MT s and has a maximum memory bandwidth of GB s The console contains GB of GDDR memory times the amount of RAM found in the PS and is expected to give the console considerable longevity It also includes secondary custom chips that handle tasks associated with downloading uploading and social gameplay These tasks can be handled seamlessly in the background during gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode The console also contains an audio module which can support in game chat as well as a very large number of audio streams for use in game All PlayStation models support high dynamic range HDR color profiles Its read

over the controller and assist them through some difficult portion of the game he said Share Play requires a PlayStation Plus subscription and can only be used for one hour at a time Games PlayStation games are distributed at retail on Blu ray Disc and digitally as downloads through the PlayStation Store Games are not region locked so games purchased in one region can be played on consoles in all regions and players can sign on to any PS console to access their entire digital game library All PlayStation games must be installed to the console s storage Additionally a system called PlayGo allows users to begin to play portions of a game such as opening levels once the installation or download reaches a specific point while the remainder of the game is downloaded or installed in the background Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby PS users will in the future be able to browse games and stream games via Gaikai to demo them almost instantaneously Sony says it is committed to releasing an ever increasing number of free to play games including PlanetSide and War Thunder Sony also took steps to make it easier for independent game developers to release games for the PS by giving them the option to self publish their own games rather than rely upon others to distribute their games Backward compatibility PlayStation is not compatible with any disc of older PlayStation consoles Emulated versions of selected PlayStation PlayStation and PlayStation Portable games are available for purchase via PlayStation Store which are upscaled to high definition and have support for PS social features PlayStation Now In December Andrew House indicated that Sony was planning to launch a cloud gaming service for the PS in North America within the third quarter of with a European launch to follow in At Consumer Electronics Show on January Sony unveiled PlayStation Now a digital distribution service which will initially allow users to access PlayStation games on the PS via a cloud based streaming system purchasing games individually or via a subscription as a solution of no backward compatibility on the hardware of the console The United States Open Beta went live on July The official United States release of the service was on January As of March PlayStation Now was in closed beta in the United Kingdom Release Critical reception Pre release Pre release reception to the console from developers and journalists was positive Mark Rein of Epic Games praised the enhanced architecture of Sony s system describing it as a phenomenal piece of hardware John Carmack programmer and co founder of id Software also commended the design by saying Sony made wise engineering choices while Randy Pitchford of Gearbox Software expressed satisfaction with the amount of high speed memory in the console Eurogamer also called the graphics technology in the PS impressive and an improvement from the difficulties developers experienced on the PlayStation Numerous industry professionals have acknowledged the PlayStation s performance advantage over the Xbox One Speaking to Edge magazine multiple game developers have described the difference as significant and obvious ExtremeTech says the PS s graphics processing unit offers a serious advantage over the competition but due to the nature of cross platform development games that share the same assets will appear very similar In other scenarios designers may tap some of PS s additional power in a straightforward manner to boost frame rate or output at a higher resolution whereas games from Sony s own first party studios that take full advantage of the hardware will probably look significantly better than anything on the Xbox One In response to concerns surrounding the possibility of DRM measures to hinder the resale of used games and in particular the initial DRM policies of Xbox One which did contain such restrictions Jack Tretton explicitly stated during Sony s E press conference that there would be no restrictions on the resale and trading of PS games on physical media while software product development head Scott Rohde specified that Sony was planning to disallow online passes as well going on to say that the policies were designed to be consumer friendly extremely retailer friendly and extremely publisher friendly After Sony s E press conference IGN responded positively to Sony s attitude towards indie developers and trading games stating they thought most gamers would agree that if you care about games like Sony do you ll buy a PlayStation PlayStation s removable and upgradable hard drive also drew praise from IGN with Scott Lowe commenting that the decision gave the console another advantage over the Xbox One whose hard drive cannot be accessed GameSpot called the PlayStation the gamer s choice for next generation citing its price lack of restrictive digital rights management and most importantly Sony s efforts to acknowledge its consumers and respect its audience as major factors Post release The PlayStation has received very positive reviews by critics Scott Lowe of IGN gave it an rating out of praising the console s DualShock design and social integration features He criticized the console s lack of software features and for underutilizing the DualShock s touch pad The Gadget Show gave a similar review complimenting the DualShock s new triggers and control sticks in addition to the new Remote Play feature yet criticized the system s lack of media support at launch IGN compared the Xbox One and the PlayStation over various categories allowing their readers to vote for their preferred system The PS won every category offered and IGN awarded the PS with their People s Choice Award Shortly following the launch it became apparent that some games released on multiple platforms were available in higher resolutions on the PS as opposed to other video game consoles Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku reported on the differences in early games such as Call of Duty Ghosts and Assassin s Creed IV Black Flag which ran at p on the PS but in p and p respectively on the Xbox One Sales Demand for PlayStation was strong In August Sony announced the placement of over a million preorders for the console while on the North American launch alone one million PlayStation consoles were sold In the UK the PlayStation became the best selling console at launch with the sale of consoles within a hour period and in the first five weeks On January Andrew House announced in his Consumer Electronics Show keynote speech that million PS units had been sold through by the end of with more than million software units sold On February Sony announced that as of February it had sold over million console units following the release of the PS onto the North American and Western Central European markets Within the first two days of release in Japan during the weekend of February consoles were sold PS software unit sales surpassed million on April During Japan s fiscal year heightened demand for the PS helped Sony top global console sales beating Nintendo for the first time in eight years According to data released by Nielsen in August nine months after the PS was released thirty one percent of its sales were to existing Wii and Xbox owners none of whom had by then owned a PS At Gamescom it was announced that million PS units had been sold through to consumers worldwide and on November it was announced that the PlayStation was the top selling console in the U S for the tenth consecutive month In its first sales announcement of Sony confirmed on January that it had sold through million PlayStation units Sony updated the sell through figures for the system throughout over million consoles as of March over million as of November and over million by the end of As of May total worldwide sell through reached million As of December over million consoles and more than million PlayStation games have been sold worldwide By October the PS had sold million times making it the second best selling home video game console of all time behind the PlayStation The PlayStation holds a market share of at least within all European countries as of June Hardware revisions The PlayStation has been produced in various models the original the Slim and the Pro Successive models have added or removed various features and each model has variations of Limited Edition consoles PlayStation Slim On September Sony announced a hardware revision of the PlayStation model number CUH known colloquially as the PlayStation Slim which phased out the original model It is a revision of the original PS hardware with a smaller form factor it has a rounded body with a matte finish on the top of the console rather than a two tone finish and is smaller in size than the original model The two USB ports on the front have been updated to the newer USB standard and have a larger gap between them and the optical audio port was removed This model also features support for USB Bluetooth and GHz Wi Fi It was released on September with a GB model at the same price as the original version of the PlayStation On April Sony announced that it had replaced this base model with a TB version at the same MSRP PlayStation Pro The PlayStation Pro codenamed Neo model number CUH was announced on September and launched worldwide on November It is an upgraded version of the PlayStation with improved hardware to enable K rendering and improved PlayStation VR performance including an upgraded GPU with teraflops of processing power and hardware support for checkerboard rendering and a higher CPU clock As with PS Slim this model also features support for USB Bluetooth and GHz Wi Fi The PS Pro also includes GB of DDR memory that is used to swap out non gaming applications that run in the background allowing games to utilize an additional MB of the console s GDDR memory Although capable of streaming K video the PS Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu ray Games marketed by Sony as PS Pro Enhanced have specific optimizations when played on this model such as K resolution graphics and or higher performance For games not specifically optimized an option known as Boost Mode was added on system software which can be enabled to force higher CPU and GPU clock rates on existing games to possibly improve performance Rendering games at K resolution is achieved through various rendering techniques and hardware features PlayStation technical chief Mark Cerny explained that Sony could not brute force K without compromising form factor and cost so the console was designed to support streamlined rendering techniques using custom hardware best in breed temporal and spatial anti aliasing algorithms and many new features from the AMD Polaris architecture as well as several even beyond it The most prominent technique used is checkerboard rendering wherein the console only renders portions of a scene using a checkerboard pattern and then uses algorithms to fill in the non rendered segments The checkerboarded screen can then be smoothed using an anti aliasing filter Hermen Hulst of Guerrilla Games explained that PS Pro could render something perceptively so close to K that you wouldn t be able to see the difference PS Pro supports Remote Play Share Play and streaming at up to p resolution at frames per second as well as capturing screenshots at p and p video at frames per second In late Sony issued a new PS Pro revision model number CUH that featured updated internal components The actual hardware specifications and performance remained the same as the original model although it was found that the revised console has a slightly quieter fan profile than the original and as a result was operating at a slightly higher temperature under load than the CUH In October Sony quietly issued another revision model number CUH initially as part of Red Dead Redemption hardware bundles The revision has a different power supply which uses the same type of cord as the Slim model and was shown to have further improvements to acoustics
