excessive sexual or violent content such as Mortal Kombat X Grand Theft Auto or The Witcher Twitch took temporary action in May after channels related to the video game Artifact began to be used for inappropriate content Artifact a major game by Valve had lost most of its audience in just months from its release and by late May several popular livestreamers commented that the total viewership for

these new streams were playing with the viewers or were jokes such as showing animal videos or League of Legends matches After a few days other Artifact channel streams appeared containing content that was against the terms of Twitch s use policy including full copyrighted movies pornography Nazi propaganda and at least one stream that showed the entirety of the shooter s video from the Christchurch mosque shootings The titles of such streams were usually presented to imply they were showing other content while waiting in queue for Artifact matches as to appear legitimate As word of

containing the Confederate Flag and racist emotes though the list of such emotes has not been clarified yet The new policy included banning words that were considered sexual insults such as incel and virgin when used for harassment The banned words included simp which raised criticism by streamers and long time viewers While its slang origins have defined simp derogatorily as a man who invests a lot of time and energy into women who don t want him the term had become common on Twitch as an insult related to men being nice to women on the service or simply to refer to a person with loyalty to another Twitch in response clarified that penalties for using these terms would only be enforced if they were being used in harassment of other users On December Twitch removed the blind playthrough tag due to concerns of ableism that it may be offensive to those who are visually impaired Suggestions for non offensive and more neutral labels include first playthrough undiscovered and no spoilers
