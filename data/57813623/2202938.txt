A Lego minifigure often simply referred to as a Lego figure or a minifig is a small plastic articulated figurine made of special Lego bricks produced by Danish building toy manufacturer The Lego Group They were first produced in and have been a success with over billion produced worldwide as of Minifigures are usually found within Lego sets although they are also sold separately as collectables in blind bags e g under the Lego theme of the same name or can be custom built in Lego stores and on lego com While some are named as specific characters either licensed from already existing franchises or of Lego s own creation many are unnamed and are designed simply to fit within a certain theme such as police officers astronauts and pirates They are highly customizable and parts from different figures can be mixed and matched resulting in many combinations There are also other types of figures from Lego sets such as animals Duplo figures or mini doll figures The Lego minifigure is together with the Lego brick the company s mascot and one of the most popular toys of all time Minifigures are collected by both children and adults Similar figures often called Lego compatible minifigures are also produced by various other companies often as clones knock offs such as Kre O called Kreons Lepin Cobi Block Tech or Mega Bloks History A precursor to the minifigure was released in These were at the same scale as the current minifigures but had a different design They had solid torsos without separate movable arms solid lower body pieces that were not moveable and heads without printed features They had a small variety of headpieces in various colors including caps pigtail hair and cowboy hats The first modern minifigures were released in included in Castle Space and Town sets These were designed by Jens Nygaard Knudsen who had come up with the idea for having the torsos legs and arm pieces interchangeable As these were made into pieces the company decided to give them a simple facial expression rendered as two solid black dots for eyes and a smile painted in solid black and without any gender or racial components believing that these factors would be determined by the child s imagination and play In for the launch of Pirates theme some minifigures also included hooks for hands as well as peg legs this was the first departure from the traditional body parts Starting with Lego Pirates in and spreading to Lego Town and Lego Castle in the next few years minifigures were also produced with different facial expressions such as facial hair eye patches feminine makeup and sunglasses Most of these early facial additions were still centered around the two eyes and smile however starting in with Willa the Witch of the Fright Knights facial expressions became more complex including open mouths and detailed eyes Another departure from traditional parts was the use of spring loaded legs These legs are joined at the top These legs were only featured in basketball sets Other leg variations include short legs for children or dwarfs or long legs used in the Toy Story and Avatar themes In the first minifigures with naturalistic skin tones as opposed to the yellow used until this point were released as part of the Lego Basketball theme these minifigures were also created in the likeness of living people additionally this also included Lando Calrissian in the Star Wars theme In April the Harry Potter theme began to use natural skin tones and Lego Star Wars followed in June and by the use of natural skin tones was expanded to all licensed products in which figures were created to represent film actors and other living people Popular examples between and include Star Wars Marvel Batman The Lord of the Rings and Indiana Jones minifigures By Lego had reportedly produced billion minifigures There are at least different minifigures produced between and and the number of new minifigures per year is increasing rapidly In more than new minifigures were introduced Some minifigures repeatedly appear across multiple Lego sets while others can be very rare often vastly increasing their resale value In the number of Lego Star Wars minifigures has surpassed with the Battlefront II protagonist Iden Versio bearing code sw Design and construction The height of a typical minifigure is centimetres in Minifigures generally feature six parts widely referred to as tools in the toy industry head torso hips arms hands and legs these six parts allow seven points of articulation swivel head swivel arms swivel wrists and swivel legs Minifigures are usually packaged as three separate parts in Lego sets head torso and legs The plastic is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS a tough material that makes LEGO figures durable The plastic is melted into specially designed molds that produce the different parts of the minifigure Some of the molds are also accessories such as weapons swords guns lightsabers etc or everyday accessories cups food tools etc Heads and torsos nearly always need further decoration and sometimes the arms and legs as well This difficult process is why the figures are more expensive than any other Lego products After being printed the head is placed on the torso the legs attached and the arms are snapped on The figures are finally bagged and readied for sale Use Minifigure heads are cylindrical and attach to a long narrow cylinder molded onto the top of the torso which allows the head to rotate This feature also allows items to be attached to the figures over the torso such as air tanks jet packs paper or fabric capes breastplates or beards The heads have a stud on top which is the same size as studs on standard Lego bricks which could allow one to be placed on it The head is the only component of the minifigure which can be used for other applications blank minifigure heads have often been used in Lego sets to replicate other objects such as lampshades and electrical appliances Head accessories vary widely and include hair helmets and hats The legs rotate independently to degrees forward and nearly degrees backward Minifigures also connect to standard Lego bricks in both a sitting or standing position The hands of a minifigure resemble the letter C which allows them to hold many Lego accessories as well as bricks tiles and plates There are hundreds of a vast variety of accessories including swords axes wands cups guns blasters and lightsabers Additionally the tops of the hands are the same size as the studs on most Lego bricks which allows them to be placed on top of them These variations allow minifigures to be customized keeping with the modular design of Lego elements Design variations While nearly all minifigure heads torsos arms hands and legs are the same size and shape some sets have included figures that deviate from the standard Torso Lego torsos often have black or white squares on the neck joint this is to help with the automatic printing process when producing minifigures Minifigures built from special uniquely molded pieces were first introduced in Life on Mars Martians are composed of five tools two pairs of double arms a mechanical torso a conjoined leg piece and a head This configuration is also used for many Star Wars droids standard battle droids follow the same pattern while super battle droids feature a head fixed to a torso General Grievous has space for four arms and IG has a head constructed of other Lego pieces R D and other astromech droids are constructed from unique parts with a separate top body and legs The robots of Exo Force Mars Mission commander aliens and Bionicle miniatures have a design similar to the Star Wars battle droids but with separate legs movable hands and a head affixed to a small torso Hagrid the half giant character from the Harry Potter series uses a larger minifigure body with only the head being separable Skeletons use the standard minifigure head but unique torsos arms and legs designed to resemble a skeletal structure although different these figure parts are still detachable Skeleton figures and others alike stir up controversy on whether they should be considered a minifigure or just a figure due to the lack of standard minifigure parts Additionally some minifigures mostly pirates sometimes include peg legs and hook hands Legs Shorter legs without joints at the hip are sometimes used to create minifigures which are shorter in stature than standard figures i e children dwarfs gnomes goblins Ewoks and other small characters like Yoda or The Penguin Such pieces were first created for Star Wars sets but have since been used elsewhere In a medium sized pair of legs was introduced sized between the shorter legs and regular legs These legs had a joint at the hip to allow individual movement of the legs and were used to represent younger teenagers introduced for the rebooted Harry Potter theme Some minifigures particularly in Castle and Pirate sets use large sloped bricks instead of legs to resemble dresses or skirts However these sloped bricks are taller than standard minifigure legs In a special skirt piece was released shorter more softly curved on the back and with regular leg pins to connect to the torso instead of the studs on ordinary bricks For The Simpsons theme as well as other themes like Harry Potter a skirt fabric has been created allowing the minifigure to wear skirts However the first skirt mold appeared for the Minnie Mouse and Alice minifigures within the Disney Collectible minifigures theme The mold for the Ballerina s skirt does predate the Disney minifigures by several months but it resembles a straight up oval plate and considered a tutu Other legs include smoke legs mermaid tail legs snake tail legs and octopus legs Head Minifigures have also featured unique head sculpts that differ from the traditional cylindrical shape the first was Jar Jar Binks included in a Star Wars set in Since then various other minifigures like Yoda C PO Harry Potter goblin figures tuskens geonosians Zeb Orrelios Kit Fisto Plo Koon Davy Jones and Bossk also use non standard heads Kit Fisto was the first minifigure to not use an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene head using rubber instead Traditional accessories such as hats and helmets cannot be placed on these non standard heads Some minifigures such as wookiees gamorrean guards and ewoks use instead of a normal head a special piece consisting of head and chest which fits over the body Pong Krell uses a similar piece consisting of a head chest and two additional arms The bas SpongeBob has a sculpted Lego brick head that fits like a standard head similar to the ghost figures except that these figures use short or standard legs instead of a brick Head and neck wear An enormous variety of clothing and accessories has been produced for minifigures including hairstyles caps hats and helmets In Star Wars sets troopers have uniquely sculpted helmets adapting the original character designs to the minifigure format Some minifigures like Balin from The Hobbit have a hair piece that exends as a beard to the chest Exo Force minifigures feature anime style hair as does the Nightwing minifigure from the Batman Arkham Asylum set Old Boba Fett and Jango Fett minifigures had helmet pieces which back half stretched down to the minifigures back in the form of a jet pack Classic ghost figures have a full body cape which attaches to the head of the minifigure and solid brick like legs Others The minifigures of The Lord of the Rings character Gollum consists only of three pieces One piece forms the body consisting of torso head and legs in a crawling position and two arms specially made for this minifigure Some other minifigures like The Phantom Menace character Sebulba consists entirely of only one piece Material Lego released multiple minifigures made of metal instead of plastic gold colored chrome minifigures of the Star Wars character C PO were released in random Lego Star Wars sets in The most extreme design variations were an edition of five minifigures of C PO released in and two minifigures of the character Boba Fett released in cast in solid karat gold with a figure estimated to cost between and NASA s Juno spacecraft which entered orbit around the planet Jupiter in carries three specially commissioned minifigures on board Cast from space grade aluminum the minifigures represent the astronomer Galileo the Roman deity Jupiter and his wife Juno This also set the record for the furthest distance travelled by a Lego minifigure As part of other objects Various minifigures from multiple themes have been released as keychains The pieces of these figures are inseparable and a metal chain and keychain ring are attached to their heads Various minifigures were also released as a part of pens in the Lego Writing theme Variations In some Lego products figures other than standard minifigures are used A catalog that shows all these Lego figures is available Animal figures Lego also features a variety of similar figures for non anthropomorphic animals and other creatures like horses dogs cows goats cats rats mice skunks koalas elephants a variety of dinosaurs spiders snakes smaller fish sharks squids owls crabs parrots alligators centaurs or the varactyl from Revenge of the Sith Friends The Friends theme released in included mini doll figures a more doll like construction with more realistic anatomy soon introduced into other themes chiefly aimed at girls Even though the mini dolls in the Lego Friends theme have more realistic anatomy the mini dolls legs can only move ninety degrees into a sitting position The mini dolls legs are also molded together and can not move separately as the traditional Lego minifigure legs can The mini doll in the Lego Friends theme is slightly taller than the traditional minifigure Non disassemblable figures Lego Duplo includes figures that have less articulation than standard minifigures and cannot be disassembled for safety reasons Likewise the Fabuland collection produced in the s consisted of larger anthropomorphized animal characters which also could not be easily disassembled Belville and Scala Lego products marketed to girls also include larger scale figures These figures are similar to Technic figures in articulation but feature less angular body sculpts Scala figures more closely resemble dolls in that clothes are separate from the figures and hair is made of strands rather than molded plastic The Baby line included figures that could not move at all and had the size a bit bigger than the Duplo figures Figures built entirely from standard bricks Creator sets also often feature animals built entirely of more classic Lego bricks Some droids from Star Wars such as droidekas dwarf and homing spider droids and pit droids and various animals and other creatures appearing in themes like Harry Potter The Lord of the Rings or Vikings like dragons the giant dog Fluffy or giant spiders like Shelob Aragog or the mirkwood spiders are entirely brick built Some of these figures are still considered minifigures At the Legoland parks the standardized Miniland design has long been used as a template for brick built figures and has occasionally appeared in sets Nanofigures Lego Nanofigures are miniature versions of original minifigures following the same general shape but without any moving parts roughly the same height as a regular minifigure s legs From they were initially produced in metal colors to represent trophies and statuettes but from onwards they got printing to represent characters in sets produced in micro scale too small for regular minifigures or to represent diminutive characters such as Ant Man They are also available in smaller scale sets such as Hogwarts Castle Microfigures Within the Lego Games theme the Lego microfigures were released For that name they are about half the size of the regular Lego minifigure The microfigures have a fixed head small non movable legs which somewhat resemble normal minifigure legs and a hint of shoulders for arms Bigfigures Bigfigures are Lego figurines that are taller and more muscular then regular minifigures which were introduced in Though most share the same body shape and pose There have been a few variations such as Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars or the wampa and the rancor which are even bigger in size Most bigfigures don t contain removable heads though there have been recent exceptions such as Thanos A precursor to the bigfigure was released in under the Rock Raiders theme Baby figure In a new mold for a minifigure style human baby was introduced Although similar to a microfigure in body shape it has a detachable head and actual molded arms albeit non posable It has mainly made appearances in LEGO City sets such as the Fun at the Park set It was also notable for appearing as an accessory for the Babysitter in the th series of Lego Minifigures and LEGO Assembly Square which is the Lego Modular Building In The Mandalorian sets the Grogu figure uses this body mold Technic Technic used larger scale action figures between and These figures featured more realistic sculpts although still distinctively angular and featured more articulation including bendable elbows and knees These figures are further distinguished from minifigures in that they cannot be easily disassembled even the hair pieces are non removable Bionicle and similar In Lego further expanded the minifigure system with the introduction of Bionicle figures These figures are a part of a fictional story developed by Lego and resemble biomechanical creatures Initially these figures were produced without articulation only able to hold tools and weapons Bionicle later got replaced with Hero Factory in In Lego released Bionicle playsets with minifigure variations of characters that had previously been produced in the larger Bionicle scale notably the Toa and Visorak characters While these minifigures did not feature movable parts Lego released Piraka and Inika playsets in which included minifigures with movable parts Light up light sabers Other variations of the standard minifigure produced for Star Wars sets included the light up light saber L U L S minifigures These figures were released as a part of the more expensive Star Wars Episode III sets in These figures look like standard minifigures but to facilitate internal electronics their parts cannot be removed the only exception to this is the headgear the left hand and arm and each of the legs from the hips When the head is pressed down an LED illuminates the light saber blade These figures rely on battery power for their special feature The batteries last three hours and are not intended to be replaced although replacement is possible Many fans especially children were amenable to this innovation Others however particularly adult collectors found these figures contentious considering them to be an unwelcome gimmick The fact that in two cases unique characters were produced solely as L U L minifigs with no standard version available to collectors was also an unpopular decision Following the initial release of these figures Lego announced no more were to be produced due to their unpopularity and more expensive production One set the Clone Turbo Tank which featured an L U L version of Mace Windu was even reissued with a standard version of the minifig and an extra Clone Trooper figure to make up the cost of the set There was also at least one high end City themed set Police HQ that included a police officer with a light up torch Another L U L S minfig in police uniform appeared without the saber part of the light saber and a yellow LED in the handle of the light saber reusing the L U L S design outside the Star Wars setting as an effective torch He appeared in a high end City set based on a standard and well selling City Police HQ design A complaint about the set was that the L U L S minifig was contained in a try me compartment of the box allowing customers and excited children to wear down his battery while he was still on the shelf The set was discontinued after a year with a separate identical design but with extra normal minifgs replacing the L U L S minfig Magnets Yet another variation on the minifigure is the magnet figure from such themes as Star Wars Batman Indiana Jones and City The magnet figures are not included in regular sets but are instead sold in packs of three or more Some of these include accessories and display base bricks These figures include magnets in their legs which allow them to stick to metal surfaces Magnet figures are nearly indistinguishable from standard figures in appearance Unlike the LUL figures only the torso and the hips of magnet minifigures are inseparable Others Some Lego sets from on included much larger figures where only the heads and hair were special pieces This is the reason why the usual figures are mini Objects like alarm clocks in the form of minifigures have also been released Customisation and clones Minifigure customisation often called MOCs is the practice of modifying Lego minifigures This can be as simple as mixing and matching parts or as complex as painting or remolding plastic Some custom minifigures are made by affixing stickers or decals to the figures There are also third party businesses which sell custom decals and molded minifigure accessories many of which are inspired by popular media and While a relatively recent phenomenon minifigure customisation has rapidly become popular within the wider building community although some maintain a purist approach using only elements produced by Lego The Lego Group executives are using personalised minifigures in place of business cards with email addresses and telephone numbers details on the front and back of the torso and hair and facial features designed to resemble each executive It is believed that over of these exist Collecting Both children and adult fans of Lego collect Lego Minifigures without collecting the sets The Lego group has produced more than Minifigures in the past years and many people buy and sell these on eBay and other sites such as Bricklink Some of the most expensive and rare minifigures can be viewed at Rare and Expensive Lego Minifigures Depictions in other media Brickfilms Various stop motion animated films and television series are made using Lego minifigures Official Lego media The Lego Group produced various short films feature films and video games featuring Lego minifigures and bricks Most of these are based on other already existing franchises like Star Wars or DC Comics These films are created using primarily computer generated animation they are styled in such a way as to emulate the look of stop motion brickfilms even being influenced by some popular brickfilms Multiple video games also feature Lego minifigures and bricks The minifigures featured in them have additional articulation and mobility as well as textural modifications to create a realistic effect Often these media feature a vast population of minifigures living in a vast Lego universe setting and rely heavily on meta humor about this fact Other famous depictions In January a Lego minifigure carrying a Canadian flag was sent up to the stratosphere and garnered worldwide attention In Lego minifigures were featured in Toy Story and the Toy Story short Hawaiian Vacation Lego Minifigures theme The Collectible Minifigures later renamed to Lego Minifigures theme introduced in is a set of individually packaged blind bag minifigures Each series consists of approximately new and exclusive minifigures with a random assortment of polybags per box A new series is released every three to four months with some having a theme e g monsters or masquerade and others including a wide variety of minifigs Several blogs publish feel guides to help collectors figure out which minifigures are inside the opaque package The minifigures can be based on fictional archetypes history or jobs sports life styles and hobbies i e Punk Rocker Dino Tracker Caveman All CMF minifigures come with a Lego stand Most CMF come with an often unique accessory and many have uniquely printed body parts Similar bags have also been released for Harry Potter Marvel
