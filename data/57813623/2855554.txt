IMDb an acronym for Internet Movie Database is an online database of information related to films television series podcasts home videos video games and streaming content online including cast production crew and personal biographies plot summaries trivia ratings and fan and critical reviews IMDb began as a fan operated movie database on the Usenet group rec arts movies in and moved to the Web in Since it has been owned and operated by IMDb com Inc a subsidiary of Amazon The site s message boards were disabled in February As of IMDb was the nd most visited website on the Internet as ranked by Alexa As of March the database contained some million titles including television episodes million person records and million registered users Features The title and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all users but only registered and logged in users can submit new material and suggest edits to existing entries Most of the site s data has been provided by these volunteers Registered users with a proven track record are able to add and make corrections to cast lists credits and some other data points However the addition and removal of images and alterations to titles cast and crew names character names and plot summaries are subject to an approval process this usually takes between and hours On October character filmographies were added Character entries are created from character listings in the main filmography database and as such do not need any additional verification by IMDb staff They have already been verified when they are added to the main filmography Registered users can choose their username and most are pseudonymous There is no single index of contributors no index on each profile page of the items contributed and except for plot synopses and biographies no identification of contributors to each product s or person s data pages Users are also invited to rate titles on a scale of to and the totals are converted into a weighted mean rating with filters in place to mitigate ballot stuffing User profile pages show a user s registration date and optionally their personal ratings of titles Since badges can be added showing a count of contributions These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos trivia and biographies If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb page they can add photos through IMDbPRO User ratings of films As one adjunct to data the IMDb offers a rating scale that allows users to rate titles on a scale of one to ten IMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways to produce a weighted mean that is displayed for each title It states that filters are used to deter ballot stuffing the methodology and details for how its ratings are calculated are confidential and not accessible to the public In fact it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean Rankings The IMDb Top is a list of the top rated films based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described As of September The Shawshank Redemption directed by Frank Darabont is No on the list and has been since The Top rating is based on only the ratings of regular voters The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top list they deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter In addition to other weightings the Top films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in actuarial science as a credibility formula This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information in this case from eligible users who submit ratings Although the current formula is not disclosed IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating W R v C m v m displaystyle W frac R cdot v C cdot m v m where W is the weighted rating R is the mean rating for the movie from to v is the number of votes for the movie m is the minimum votes required to be listed in the Top as of C is the mean vote across the whole report as of The variable W in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean see Bayesian statistics The IMDb also has a Bottom feature which is assembled through a similar process although only votes must be received to qualify for the list The Top list comprises a wide range of feature films including major releases cult films independent films critically acclaimed films silent films and non English language films Documentaries short films and TV episodes are not currently included Since there has been a Top list devoted to ranking television shows Reference view IMDb originally used a more sidebar list based view on title pages However in the site updated pages to more free flowing layouts and offered logged in users an advanced view site preference setting called Combined view or this could be done on an ad hoc basis by simply adding combined to the end of the URL e g https www imdb com title tt combined for users to choose should they prefer the older page view display method or to aid the editing of data In some alterations were made to this advanced view and the setting was renamed Reference view again also able to be accessed ad hoc by simply adding reference to the end of the URL e g https www imdb com title tt reference with the former combined URLs made to link to the newer reference ones Message boards Beginning in the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title excepting as of TV episodes which used the same message board for the whole series and name entry along with over main boards To post on the message boards a user needed to authenticate their account via cell phone credit card or by having been a recent customer of the parent company Amazon com Message boards expanded in recent years The Soapbox started in as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects The Politics board started in was a message board to discuss politics news events and current affairs as well as history and economics By February all the message boards and their content were permanently removed According to the website the decision was made because the boards were no longer providing a positive useful experience for the vast majority of our more than million monthly users worldwide Others have mentioned its susceptibility to trolling and disagreeable behavior Needham also mentioned in a post some months earlier that the boards received less income from ads and that their members only made up a very small part of the website s visitors The boards were costly to run due to the system s age and dated design which did not make business sense The decision to remove the message boards was met with outspoken backlash from some of its users and sparked an online petition garnering over signatures In the days leading up to February both Archive org and MovieChat org preserved the entire contents of the IMDb message boards using web scraping Archive org and MovieChat org have published IMDb message board archives IMDbPro Actors crew and industry

and privileges History Pre website IMDb originated in with a Usenet posting entitled Those Eyes by the English film fan and computer programmer Col Needham about actresses with beautiful eyes Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own Needham subsequently started an Actors List while Dave Knight began a Directors List and Andy Krieg took over THE LIST from Cody Phillips which would later be renamed the Actress List Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working but soon retired people were added so Needham started what was then but did not remain a separate Dead Actors Actresses List Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists When these achieved popularity they were merged back into the lists themselves The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible By late the lists included almost films and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein On October Needham developed and posted a collection of Unix shell scripts that could be used to search the four lists and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born At the time it was known as the rec arts movies movie database On the Web The database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia biographies and plot summaries The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay Later on August it moved onto the fledgling World Wide Web under the name of Cardiff Internet Movie Database The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of Cardiff University in Wales Rob Hartill was the original web interface author In the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates However the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein Over the next few years the database was run on a network of mirrors across the world with donated bandwidth As an independent company In IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd Founder Col Needham became the primary owner General revenue for site operations was generated through advertising licensing and partnerships As Amazon com subsidiary present In Jeff Bezos founder owner and CEO of Amazon com struck a deal with Needham and other principal shareholders to buy IMDb outright Amazon paid million for IMDb and two other companies Bezos attached it to Amazon as a subsidiary private company This gave IMDb the ability to pay the shareholders salaries for their work In the process of expanding its product line Amazon com intended to use IMDb as an advertising resource for selling DVDs and videotapes IMDb continued to expand its functionality On January it added a subscription service known as IMDbPro aimed at entertainment professionals IMDbPro was announced and launched at the Sundance Film Festival by Barnaby Dorfman It provides a variety of services including film production and box office details a company directory and the ability of subscribers to add personal information pages From onwards an annual newsletter email archived on the website has been sent from Col Needham to contributors on the first day of each calendar year The annual newsletter lists various information about the past year on the site including stats top contributors tally for the year the top users currently fewer in previous years and a perspective on the site s progress and future As an additional incentive for users as of users identified as one of the top contributors of hard data received complimentary free access to IMDbPro for the following calendar year for this was increased to the top contributors and for to the top In IMDb launched their first official foreign language version with IMDb de in German Also in IMDb acquired two other companies Withoutabox and Box Office Mojo The website was originally Perl based but IMDb no longer discloses what software it uses for reasons of security apart from mentioning The Apache Software Foundation In the site was filtered in China In The IMDb Studio at Sundance was launched a talk show that is presented on IMDb and YouTube In April IMDb celebrated its th anniversary As of that year Needham was still managing IMDb from its main office in Bristol in the Castlemead office tower In January IMDb launched an ad supported streaming service called Freedive This was the company s second attempt at a streaming service it launched a similar service in In June Freedive was rebranded as IMDb TV In April the service was rebranded again as Amazon Freevee Content and format Data provided by subjects In IMDb introduced its R sum Subscription Service where an actor or crew member can post their r sum and upload photos for a yearly fee IMDb r sum pages are kept on a sub page of the regular entry about that person with a regular entry automatically created for each r sum subscriber who does not already have one As of Resume Services was included as part of an IMDbPro subscription and is no longer offered as a separate subscription service Copyright vandalism and error issues Volunteers who contribute content to the database technically retain copyright on their contributions but the compilation of the content becomes the exclusive property of IMDb with the full right to copy modify and sublicense it and they are verified before posting However credit is not given on specific title or filmography pages to the contributor s who have provided information Conversely a credited text entry such as a plot summary may be corrected for content grammar sentence structure perceived omission or error by other contributors without having to add their names as co authors Due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed IMDb is different from user contributed projects like Discogs or OpenStreetMap or Wikipedia in that contributors cannot add delete or modify the data or text on impulse and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff IMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information in a spokesperson said We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content which is why we have an edit page The data that is submitted goes through a series of consistency checks before it goes live Given the sheer volume of the information occasional mistakes are inevitable and when reported they are promptly fixed We always welcome corrections The Java Movie Database JMDB is reportedly creating an IMDb Error log file that lists all the errors found while processing the IMDb plain text files A Wiki alternative to IMDb is Open Media Database whose content is also contributed by users but licensed under a Creative Commons license CC BY and the GFDL Since IMDb has been experimenting with wiki programmed sections for complete film synopses parental guides and FAQs about titles as determined by and answered by individual contributors Data format and access IMDb unlike other AI automated queries does not provide an API for automated queries However most of the data can be downloaded as compressed plain text files and the information can be extracted using the command line interface tools provided There is also a Java based graphical user interface GUI application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files which allows a search and a display of the information This GUI application supports different languages but the movie related data are in English as made available by IMDb A Python package called IMDbPY since renamed cinemagoer can also be used to process the compressed plain text files into a number of different SQL databases enabling easier access to the entire dataset for searching or data mining Film titles The IMDb has sites in English as well as versions translated completely or in part into other languages Danish Finnish French German Hungarian Italian Polish Portuguese Spanish and Romanian The non English language sites display film titles in the specified language Originally IMDb s English language sites displayed titles according to their original country of origin language however in IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and US to choose primary title display by either the original language titles or the US or UK release title normally in English Podcasts On October the site added the ability to add podcasts both as series and episodes as titles to the site via an IMDb employee announcement on their Sprinklr forums As of December the numbers of podcast series stood at with podcast episodes at Legal and policy issues In in the case of Hoang v Amazon com Inc IMDb was sued by an anonymous actress for at least US because the movie website publicly disclosed her age at the time without her consent The actress claimed that revealing her age could cause her to lose acting opportunities Judge Marsha J Pechman a US district judge in Seattle dismissed the lawsuit saying the actress had no grounds to proceed with an anonymous complaint The actress re filed and so revealed that she was Huong Hoang of Texas who uses the stage name Junie Hoang In Pechman dismissed all causes of action except for a breach of contract claim against IMDb a jury then sided with IMDb on that claim The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment in March Also in in the case of United Video Properties Inc et al v Amazon Com Inc et al IMDb and Amazon were sued by Rovi Corporation and others for patent infringement over their various program listing offerings The patent claims were ultimately construed in a way favorable to IMDb and Rovi United Video Properties lost the case In April the decision was affirmed by the U S Court of Appeals On January the State of California enacted state bill AB a SAG AFTRA backed anti ageism statute which requires commercial online entertainment employment services to honor requests by their subscribers for their ages and birthdays to be hidden By the beginning of IMDb had received more than requests from individuals to remove their date of birth from the site Included in this group were Academy Award winners and another nominated for Oscars Emmys or Golden Globes On February Judge Vince Girdhari Chhabria issued a stay on the bill pending a further trial on the ground that it possibly violated the First Amendment because it inhibited the public consumption of information He also questioned the intent of the bill as it was ostensibly meant to target IMDb In February Chhabria struck down the statute and in June the Ninth Circuit affirmed Chhabria s judgement holding that the statute was an unconstitutional content based restriction that violated the First Amendment IMDb had long maintained that it would keep all valid information but changed that policy related to birth names in instead removing birth names that are not widely and publicly known of persons who no longer use their birth names This was done in response to pressure from LGBTQ groups against the publication of the birth names of transgender people without their consent deadnaming Any name a person had previously been credited under however continues to be maintained in the credits section Statistics As of June IMDb tracked categories See also List of online databases Goodreads Letterboxd Rotten Tomatoes References Further reading Lurrie Stephen
