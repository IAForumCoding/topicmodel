the role of Trent Hawkins a skilled spaceship pilot While on the planet Tyrian a hostile drone shoots his best friend Buce Quesillac Before dying Buce warns Trent that the drone belonged to the militaristic MicroSol megacorporation MicroSol has discovered Gravitium the game s brand of Unobtainium on Tyrian and seeks to keep it a secret Now on MicroSol s hit list Trent manages to secure a small armed spacecraft and set out to the free world of Savara Gameplay Tyrian is an arcade style vertical scrolling shooter It was developed chiefly as a homage to the works of Compile particularly their Zanac series The player controls a space ship fitted with different weapons front and back linked to the same button and up to two external pods with their own buttons and other equipment The game presents a variety of enemies some flying some fixed some on rails and bosses with many occurrences of fixed and or indestructible obstacles Before the player s starship is destroyed it must take enough damage to exhaust several points of shields which regenerate over time and armor Tyrian s full game mode features a credit and equipment buying system and the shield armor hit points which are similar to game mechanics in Raptor Call of the Shadows another PC game from the same period The arcade mode has characteristics from coin op arcade shooters such as in game powerups and extra lives Difficulty There are three levels of difficulty to choose from Easy Medium and Hard as well as the hidden options of Impossible Suicide and Lord of the Game Hard difficulty and above employ enemies with more health as well as fire more bullets per second Certain hidden levels are only available at hard difficulty which provide ample opportunities for unique powerups and upgrades In certain levels the Hard setting also prevents the player from seeing enemies outside a conical line of sight Upon completion of the game the player receives a password for one of the several hidden ships as well as the options for replaying the game at a higher difficulty setting Full story mode The full story mode is a single player mode that features a story based campaign and ship customization The story is told through the message cubes that can be collected within and read between levels Some of these messages cubes are readily available while others need to be obtained by destroying certain enemies in the preceding level At certain points in the game the storyline branches and the player is required to pick one branch The player s craft is customizable It can accommodate a front weapon and a rear weapon Shops can supply a variety of kinetic guns rayguns missiles and bombs for these two slots While the front weapons are mostly limited to forward arcs rear weapons often come with wider coverage including side and rear shots Some rear weapons have two selectable fire modes focusing either mostly forward or mostly sideways or rearward Weapons can be upgraded up to times Higher levels cost exponentially more and require a more powerful generator to support them Other upgrades include increased shields more powerful generators to allow for stronger weapons and shields more armor and higher maneuverability Shops differ in terms of the ships generators and weapons they have for sale However shops can upgrade any component even those that they don t sell The player can also purchase up to two sidekicks which fly alongside the ship Some simply act as a complementary weapon that fire whenever the ship fires others are powerful weapons with limited ammunition that need to manually activated Sidekicks may not be upgradable Arcade mode In arcade mode the player starts with a moderate ship and picks up the front guns rear guns and sidekicks along the way instead of purchasing them Front weapons are upgraded by picking up purple bubbles from destroyed enemies The number of purple orbs required increases exponentially to advance to higher power levels Front and rear guns can also be upgraded to the next level by picking up power up pods which are found by destroying a specific enemy The ship shields and generators are not upgradeable The arcade mode can be played with one or two ships by one or two players The ships are called the Dragonhead and Dragonwing Both players can combine their ships into one forming the Steel Dragon with the first player controlling the combined ship and the second player controlling a turret Tyrian enables the two players to be connected via modem The Dragonhead has front gun powerups with more variety than the Dragonwing s rear gun pickups has better maneuverability and a smaller profile making it easier to dodge enemy fire It also controls the special power up weapons such as the Soul of Zinglon or Repulsor The Dragonwing is larger and slower but more heavily armored It picks up the rear up power ups although unlike the equivalent single player rear gun the Dragonwing fires it mostly forward instead of the side or rear The Dragonwing also controls the sidekick weapons The player can also increase the power of the Dragonwing s weapon by not firing them for short time letting them to accumulate extra charges There are five charge levels for each weapon and collecting the spherical purple powerups gives the Dragonwing the ability to charge up faster Timed battle In this mode available in Tyrian only the player chooses from three levels to play in Deliani Space station and Savara The player is given a set time to complete the level while collecting power ups fighting off enemies and killing the boss When the level is complete the score is calculated depending on time spent ship s integrity destruction caused and enemies killed Super arcade The game also features in Tyrian hidden super arcade modes with specialized ships requiring the user to type in certain codewords which are shown after beating the game The first code is given by beating the regular game and each consecutive code is given after beating the mode which comes before it Super Tyrian This mode which is enabled by typing engage at the title screen disables all cheat codes and command parameters and sets the difficulty to Lord of Game or Suicide if the Scroll Lock key is held down The player possesses a Stalker ship along with a small shield and only one weapon the Atomic Rail Gun No other weapons are available however the ship is able to generate many different weapons when the player performs particular sequences of movements and weapon firing The headlight effect is always turned on in Super Tyrian which can obscure objects that are not within a degree field of view in front of the player s ship Mini games Destruct is a minigame concealed inside Tyrian reminiscent of Scorched Earth with human vs human and human vs computer modes of play It can be played by typing destruct at the main menu screen In the Zinglon s Ale mini game players must try to gather as much ale as possible while dodging wave after wave of bouncing enemies and clearing the screen of enemies fully before advancing to the next level If not cleared the game continues infinitely while growing ever harder Zinglon s Squadrons is a mini game similar to Galaxian or Galaga Large formations of ships fly down to attack Individual ships in the groups break off to fly down in various ways Players must destroy the whole fleet to advance to the next fleet In the mini game Zinglon s Revenge a giant ship projects a horizontal field of energy Small enemies fall down from above and bounce around the edges of the screen and against the energy field Touching the field or one of the small enemies could be deadly Players must shoot all the small enemies to advance to the next level Development Tyrian was developed by a credited total of people with three main drivers Alexander Brandon composer and writer Jason Emery programmer and level designer and Daniel Cook artist and interface designer For the aforementioned developers Tyrian was their first commercial video game The origins of Tyrian began as an experiment in with a young Jason Emery showing his friend Alexander Brandon the preliminary workings of a scrolling background The two continued developing and eventually decided the work could be shown to a game company Brandon wrote a proposal document and sent it to the two leading shareware game publishers of the time Epic MegaGames and Apogee However the game lacked any sound or music and the graphics were definitely not professional As such neither got overly excited but both showed interest The two developers thought they would never find a publisher However after a long wait Robert Allen head of Safari Software considered Tyrian to fit perfectly with their company which handled smaller scale projects Robert Allen had word from Cliff Bleszinski that Tyrian was very similar to Zanac thinking that it should be followed up Robert Allen gave leads to sound coders and artists the first being Bruce Hsu who created interface graphics and character faces Artist Daniel Cook was hired after composer Alexander Brandon showed interest in his artwork which was unbeknown to Cook sent around by a friend After he was sent a short list of levels Cook created sample artwork on an Amiga It was met with praise by the other developers who asked him to make some more The artwork was completed in a month period After work began on graphics the popularity of Tyrian rose at Epic MegaGames Arturo Sinclair from Storm Front Studios joined to create rendered artwork for planets and character faces The developers wanted a simple and fun interface and changed it at least three times before deciding on a final design At this point Tyrian was almost complete with the Loudness sound system near completed sound effects and a marketing plan head by Mark Rein At this time Tim Sweeney approached the team and informed them Tyrian was to be published as a full fledged Epic MegaGames product It was later released in The data cubes found in the game s Full Mode contain various references to its parent publishers including One Must Fall Jazz Jackrabbit and Pretzel Pete Tyrian The Pretzel Pete Truck and its weapon is a reference to the Pretzel Pete video game Versions and re releases Tyrian Version of the game was originally released as shareware on September consisting of
