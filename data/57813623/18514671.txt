content Roblox has received widespread criticism for its chat filtration system Although Roblox s filtration system Community Sift censors and removes most inappropriate messages and content some can still avoid the system To combat these issues Roblox has people working to remove such content from the platform Roblox offers privacy settings parents can limit what people a user can contact restrict access to private servers and turn on parental controls Though sexual content is prohibited on Roblox the platform has received substantial criticism for the presence of sexually explicit games and imagery within it This content includes items such as virtual sex clubs and nightclubs with creators of said content largely communicating through third party platforms which cannot be regulated by Roblox moderators A investigation by Fast Company found that sexual content was still prevalent within Roblox with attempts by moderators to remove it being likened to whack a mole though it was also found that the situation had generally improved in the recent years prior to the report In an October interview Roblox Chief Scientist Morgan McGuire stated that it s a challenge to moderate D and also compared moderating Roblox to shutting down speakeasies Accusations of encouraging consumerism Roblox has been criticized for making it easy for children to spend large sums of money through microtransactions leading to numerous instances where children have spent large sums of money on the platform without parents knowledge and deleting the accounts of players who file chargebacks or request refunds for Robux payments through their banks card issuers or other third party companies Professor Jane Juffer at Cornell University accused Roblox of encouraging consumerism

reported that numerous games on Roblox have recreated mass shootings and criticized its moderation team for being unable to moderate them An example of this were three different games that simulated

exception with them claiming to have a team dedicated to moderating extremist content Gamesindustry biz however mentioned the company being criticized in the past for being unable to moderate games that recreated real world shootings Alleged exploitative practices towards children Roblox has been accused by the investigative journalism YouTube channel People Make Games of exploiting child game developers by promising them huge amounts of money when they monetize their games while only giving them little to no money in return by having high revenue cuts an exchange rate in selling Robux lower than the rate for buying Robux and lack of methods to make their games easily discoverable This was likened to company scrip In a discussion with Axios Roblox s chief product officer CPO Manuel Bronstein responded by saying that Roblox intends to give more money to its community developers After Roblox requested the channel to take down the video People Make Games instead released further accusations of practices endangering child safety such as a lack of oversight of developers and a method for people to address developer abuse leading to child developers being exploited for labor on third party platforms allowing a developer to seemingly continue monetizing and having control of game development despite having their personal account banned for reportedly sexually preying on a child running the collectibles market to function like gambling and thus encouraging children to seek unofficial and unsafe trading sites to easily obtain highly valuable items and refusing to help a developer whose account was hacked and had its collectibles and assets stolen Kardashian Roblox scandal The series premiere of The Kardashians which debuted on April titled Burn Them All to the F cking Ground led to a public feud between Kim Kardashian and Roblox In the episode Kim s son Saint West shows his mother an experience on the platform from a tablet that depicts an image of Kim crying across the skybox and baseplate She claimed however that the person who uploaded the experience had also obtained footage of her and Ray J s sex tape and that she reacted by crying and claiming to later sue the company Despite this allegation the incident has been seen by many as a hoax and was deceptively edited and staged as a way to cause uproar and false drama A spokesperson for Roblox responded by saying The referenced video was never available on our platform We have strict moderation and policies to protect our community including zero tolerance for sexual content of any kind which violates our community rules and The text reference to the tape that got around our filters was quickly taken down and fortunately visible only to an extremely small number of people on the platform We also swiftly took down the associated experience and banned the community developer involved with the incident An individual close to the Kardashian family denied accusations of faking the
