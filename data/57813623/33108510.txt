March and in Europe on March It is a spin off of the Gears of War series and a prequel to the entire franchise The game follows Damon Baird Augustus Cole and their squad Kilo as they are put on trial for disobeying orders just six weeks after Emergence Day Gears of War Judgment received positive reactions from critics but a poor reception from fans The game underperformed commercially selling only million copies by August Gameplay Like its predecessors Gears of War Judgment is a third person shooter with an over the shoulder perspective and cover system The main campaign is divided into six chapters each with several missions Unlike the previous games in the series which used very large open environments missions are self contained portions of the overall story and returning to earlier missions settings is never possible Each mission is scored on several criteria including the number of kills by the player head shots and gibs and up to three stars are awarded During each mission an optional harder setting is available mandates certain criteria such as a time limit or a restriction on usable weapons doing so increases the score Obtaining stars unlocks the separate Aftermath campaign which consists of one chapter and is a follow up to the Gears of War campaign Aftermath does not award stars or offer the harder setting seen in the Gears of War Judgment campaign Multiplayer Gears of War Judgment has two new multiplayer modes OverRun and Free for All The game has eight maps four of which are exclusive to OverRun and four of which are exclusive to COG versus COG Blue Team vs Red Team and four game modes Several key multiplayer features of the series have been changed as well including the ability to plant grenades on walls damage boosts from active reloads and the ability to carry both a shotgun and a rifle into combat though this last feature was later reinstated for all standard versus multiplayer modes except Free For All due to fan dissatisfaction However it has been confirmed that the Execution mode will return through free downloadable content two weeks after the game launches with the addition of two free maps Also absent are the Locust who only appear in OverRun instead it is now COG versus COG multiplayer Synopsis Setting The game s story takes place during flashbacks recalled by Baird and his team during a hearing at a COG military tribunal Each level is a recollection by a different member of the team Lieutenant and mechanical genius Damon Baird former Thrashball player Augustus Cole Onyx Guard cadet Sofia Hendrick and former UIR soldier Garron Paduk The reason for the hearing is Baird s unauthorized use of a lightmass missile and subsequent death penalty Upon hearing Baird s testimony it flashes back to Kilo Squad early in Emergence Day surviving as the Locust were seizing control of many human areas and seeking to take over Sera Plot Kilo Squad is put on trial for various crimes by Colonel Ezra Loomis and is given the chance to explain their actions Following orders Kilo checks out a convoy in the Old Town part of Halvo Bay only to find it destroyed Kilo proceeds to battle through Old Town and into the Museum of Military Glory where they encounter the fearsome Locust General Karn and his mount Shibboleth accompanied by hundreds of Locust Contacting Colonel Loomis Cadet Sofia Hendrick suggests using a powerful weapon known as the Lightmass Missile to take Karn out but Loomis is against the idea Realizing how dangerous Karn is Kilo decides to do it anyway and travels to the Onyx Guard Academy where they find and protect the missile s targeting beacon a bot that Lieutenant Damon Baird later names Troy With Troy in their possession Kilo travels to the Seashore Hills to the mansion of Professor Elliot creator of the missile in order to get the launch codes needed to fire the missile Fighting into the mansion Kilo must defend Troy from repeated waves of Locust as he downloads the launch codes Once they have the codes Kilo travels to the island of Onyx Point where the missile itself is fighting through entrenched Locust forces to reach and arm the missile Despite orders to the contrary they arm the missile and head back to the museum where they figure Karn is heading to lay a trap Fighting across the rooftops of Old Town Kilo sends Troy in to guide the missile and despite Loomis threatening to execute them if they go through with their plan Baird fires the Lightmass Missile at the museum blowing it up and killing hundreds of Locust Karn presumably among them Kilo then defends themselves from a massive Locust attack on their rooftop and once its over are arrested by Loomis for their actions In the present Loomis prepares to execute the squad when the Locust break into the courtroom Private Garron Paduk who particularly hates Loomis saves his life and he flees while Kilo must fight their way out and to a nearby King Raven Reaching the King Raven with Loomis Karn is revealed to have survived the Lightmass Missile and he attacks Kilo and Loomis who manage to kill his mount Shibboleth Loomis executes the heavily injured Karn and drops the charges against Kilo but demotes Baird from Lieutenant to Private for his actions In the Aftermath campaign set during Gears of War Baird and Cole return to Halvo Bay with Clayton Carmine to find a ship and reinforcements for the assault on Azura There they encounter Paduk who left the COG with Sofia sometime after the original battle and set up a community in the ruins of Halvo Bay that has both COG and UIR members with no one caring about sides only survival He agrees to lead the three to a ship that can take them to Azura As they make their way through the ruined city to the washed up Imulsion rig where Paduk s people are located the squad comes into conflict with the Locust Finally arriving at the rig the group finds no living humans and it occupied by packs of Formers Lambent Humans Fighting through the Formers they send off a flare from the roof of the rig and the survivors of Paduk s people who have moved to another part of the city send a King Raven to pick them up but they first have to hold off a determined Locust and Lambent assault Finally they board the King Raven and Paduk takes them to the flooded part of the city where a tidal wave from the sinking of Jacinto in Gears of War has beached a ship on the roof of a hotel The squad collects explosives from an armory at a police station and Baird sets them on columns at the hotel while the others cover him Unfortunately the explosives fail to collapse the hotel and the team must come up with an alternate plan Making their way into a restaurant in the hotel Baird opens three gas valves releasing the gas into the building then detonates the gas with a grenade while he Cole Paduk and Carmine use a zip line to get off the building This time the effort is successful and the building collapses putting the ship back into the water Having explained their plan to Paduk Baird asks his old friend to come with them but Paduk refuses as a group of Gears kidnapped Sofia whom he was romantically involved with causing him to hate the COG even more than he did before Paduk leaves and tells Baird to never see him again if they are to remain friends Baird Cole and Carmine set sail for Azura on the ship joining with Gorasni forces to help Marcus Fenix and the others in their assault on the island Development Microsoft announced the development of Gears of War Judgment at the company s press conference during the
