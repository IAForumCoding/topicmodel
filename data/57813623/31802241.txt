in specific areas of the map stored in common and rare containers or dropped by certain enemies Players use resources to craft new items and equipment Different recipes require different resources and crafting stations Several items in Terraria create complex crafting trees involving a large amount of items to create a single powerful piece of equipment Players have the option to customize their character s appearance when creating a new character and in game through items and NPCs Along with that players can obtain vanity items which are special armor pieces and accessories with only a cosmetic effect and dyes to change the color of equipped armor or accessories Characters have three inventory slots for armor to be equipped and several inventory slots for various accessories to provide a boost to a player s statistics such as wings or boots as well as vanity slots for all of them allowing them to be hidden behind cosmetics while retaining their effects Much like most Terraria items armor and accessories can be crafted found around the world and obtained from defeating bosses Players can encounter many different types of enemies in Terraria the occurrence of which depends on several factors including time location and random events The game features an open ended class system primarily divided into melee ranged magic and summoner classes Players may also battle bosses that utilize a number of different combat mechanics and can drop rare and valuable items Bosses are summoned by using certain items or when certain criteria are met The defeat of some bosses is directly tied to in game progression while others remain optional Defeating the Wall of Flesh boss advances the game into hardmode which adds many new enemies throughout the world as well as new NPCs and items Like bosses players can battle special enemies and mini bosses during invasions in which enemies appear constantly and they either must be defeated or a certain amount of time must pass before the event ends Terraria also features seasonal events which activate during certain periods of the real world calendar year adding new enemies and content By completing specific goals such as defeating a boss or obtaining a certain item players can attract NPCs to occupy structures or rooms they have built such as a merchant nurse or wizard Some NPCs can be acquired by finding them throughout the world and will then reside in player created houses after being rescued Players may then buy or sell items and certain services from NPCs with coins obtained from defeating enemies and bosses The game features many different biomes and areas which are each home to a unique set of enemies and challenges The Corruption Crimson and the hardmode exclusive Hallow will expand by slowly overtaking and converting nearby blocks NPCs prefer to be around certain biomes and with certain other NPCs and will raise and lower their prices and sell special items depending on if they are sufficiently happy Expert and Master mode are difficulty modes that increase the challenge of the game in exchange for some exclusive items Journey mode allows players to duplicate items adjust the world s difficulty and control weather and time at will while playing Terraria has support for mods which is facilitated by the third party tModLoader It later received official support when it was
