usually inserted as part of a preferred stock financing that requires stockholders to participate in subsequent stock offerings in order to benefit from certain antidilution protections If the stockholder does not purchase his or her pro rata share in the subsequent offering then the stockholder loses the benefit s of the antidilution provisions In extreme cases investors who do not

hopes of receiving investment business in return In the U S after discovering that this practice was not uncommon and was undermining the integrity of the financial markets U S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board MSRB severely regulated and limited the interactions and gifts giving practices between the investment industry personnel and politicians and candidates This can be seen most notably in Rule of the Investment Advisers Act of and Rules G and G of the MSRB Rule Book Pay to play occurs when investment firms or their employees make campaign contributions to politicians or candidates for office in the hope of receiving business from the municipalities that those political figures represent

office and the concern that one candidate can far outspend his opponents essentially buying the election Typically the payer an individual business or organization makes campaign contributions to public officials party officials or parties themselves and receives political or pecuniary benefit such as no bid government contracts influence over legislation political appointments or nominations special access or other favors The contributions less frequently may be to nonprofit or institutional entities or may take the form of some benefit to a third party such as a family member of a governmental official Incumbent candidates and their political organizations are typically the greatest beneficiaries of pay to play Both the Democratic and Republican parties have been criticized for the practice While the direct exchange of campaign contributions for contracts is the most visible form of pay to play the greater concern is the central role of money in politics and its skewing of both the composition and the policies of government Thus those who can pay the price of admission such as to a plate dinner or breakout session gain access to power and or its spoils to the exclusion of those who cannot or will not pay giving certain people advantages that other s don t have because they donated to your campaign Good government advocates consider this an outrage because political fundraising should have no relationship to policy recommendations Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Washington called the pay to play Congress one of the top scandals of Many seeking to ban or

have been created to regulate and control campaign contributions Furthermore many third party government watchdog groups have formed to monitor campaign donations and make them more transparent The U S Securities and Exchange Commission has created a rule that puts some restrictions on asset managers when they make campaign contributions The New York and Tennessee Republican parties filed a lawsuit against the SEC in August over the rule arguing that it impedes free speech seeking a preliminary injunction against the rule U S District Judge Beryl Howell questioned whether the parties have standing to bring the case noting they failed to name the potential donors and did not cite any investment advisers who are upset about the rule The opposite of a pay to play system is one that is fair and open the New Jersey Pay to Play Act specifically sets out bid processes that are or are not considered fair and open depending upon who has contributed what to whom In a series of academic research articles Christopher Cotton shows how selling access may lead to better policy decisions compared to other means of awarding access He also illustrates how wealthy interest groups are not necessarily better off from having better access to politicians Because of individual federal campaign contribution limits in the wake of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act McCain Feingold pay to play payments of soft money money not contributed directly to candidate campaigns and that does not expressly advocate election or defeat of a candidate donations to state parties and county committees
