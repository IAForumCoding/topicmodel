realigned into the AFC North Division Logo and uniforms The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club s inception the lone exception being the season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the Steagles the team s colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms Originally the team wore solid gold colored helmets and black jerseys The Steelers black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey The shade of gold differs slightly among teams the Penguins have previously used Vegas Gold a color similar to metallic gold and the Pirates gold is a darker mustard yellow gold while the Steelers gold is more of a bright canary yellow Black and gold are also the colors of the city s official flag The Steelers logo was introduced in and is based on the Steelmark originally designed by Pittsburgh s U S Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute AISI In fact it was Cleveland based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo It consists of the word Steelers surrounded by three astroids hypocycloids of four cusps The original meanings behind the astroids were Steel lightens your work brightens your leisure and widens your world Later the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel making process yellow for coal red for iron ore and blue for scrap steel While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word Steel the team was given permission to add ers in after a petition to AISI The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet the right side Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets however its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently A year after introducing the logo they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more The Steelers along with the New York Giants are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets The current uniform designs were introduced in The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys except for the and seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys In the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font Futura Condensed on the helmets and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey The third uniform consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering white pants with black and gold stripes and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers th anniversary season in They were meant to evoke the memory of the era uniforms The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only In the Steelers introduced a new third uniform consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines making a bumble bee like pattern with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their season The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants yellow with black horizontal stripped socks and the Steelers regular black helmet The uniforms were used for the Steelers th anniversary season Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the season The jerseys were nicknamed the bumblebee jerseys due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee The jerseys were retired after the season Also in the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms These were based on the uniforms they wore from to but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants In the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from to coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the s It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed In the team owners were approached by then Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team s uniforms in the image of the Steelers Three days later the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys home and away versions of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw Today the Hawkeyes still retain the Steelers uniforms as their home and away colors Rivals The Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals all within their division Cleveland Browns Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post season battles in the past most notably the Las Vegas Raiders Dallas Cowboys Denver Broncos New England Patriots and Tennessee Titans They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years Divisional rivals Cleveland Browns The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities teams began playing against each other in After posting a record in the first games of the series between the two cities the Steelers have gone including in games played in Pittsburgh since and currently lead the series The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in and won twelve straight meetings between and Additionally the Browns posted losing streaks of and present games in Pittsburgh Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator and then hired by Pittsburgh This has only intensified the rivalry The teams have met three times in the postseason and with the Steelers winning the first two meetings but losing the most recent in Baltimore Ravens Pittsburgh s rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens has had several memorable match ups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums The Steelers won the inaugural game played at Baltimore s M T Bank Stadium in and three years later the Ravens handed the Steelers their first ever loss at Heinz Field Later that season Pittsburgh won a divisional playoff game against Baltimore who was the defending Super Bowl champion During their NFL championship season in the Ravens defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge in Baltimore the Ravens final loss of the season During the Steelers Championship run they beat the Ravens three times including a win in the AFC Championship game The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses The Steelers lead the all time series including playoffs The teams have met four times in the postseason with the Steelers owning a record Cincinnati Bengals The Steelers rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals dates from the season when the AFL NFL merger was completed In the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive they later won the division with a late season win in snowy Cincinnati One of the most memorable games was the AFC Wildcard playoff game in which the Steelers en route to a Super Bowl title won a come from behind victory after Bengals QB Carson Palmer was forced to leave the game with a knee injury The injury happened when nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen contacted Palmer s knee during a passing play The Bengals players called this a dirty play the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week of the season and wide receiver T J Houshmandzadeh used a Terrible Towel to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game fueling the rivalry The Steelers and Bengals finished and with identical records and respectively splitting both regular season series the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals season in Cincinnati two years in a row eliminating them from the playoffs in and taking them out of contention in The rivalry has become more intense again since the season A central figure is Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict often inflicting brutal hits resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions In the Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely Steelers comeback victory The Steelers lead the all time series The teams have met twice in the postseason with the Steelers winning both times Conference New England Patriots The New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before the Patriots defeated the Steelers in while the Steelers won in both times the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin Martin s final game with the Patriots was in the playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets Following the AFC title upset the Patriots defeated the Steelers at the start of the season Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots record setting game winning streak in week of the NFL season Later that season the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a regular season The Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten year period before the Steelers broke through with a victory at Foxborough in after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times The Patriots in then made history by becoming the first opponent to score points on the Steelers winning The Patriots won again in and s regular season and then won in the AFC Championship Game They also won in when a go ahead touchdown reception by Steelers tight end Jesse James was controversially called back Though they ultimately missed the playoffs the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of on December in Pittsburgh In the postseason the Patriots have outscored the Steelers with the Patriots maintaining a record The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Broncos The Steelers have an all time regular season record of against the Patriots In the Bill Belichick era the main period of the rivalry the Patriots have a record against the Steelers In their last matchup the Patriots beat the Steelers on Sunday Night Football Tennessee Titans Pittsburgh also has a rivalry with the Houston Oilers Tennessee Titans franchise The Oilers were aligned into the AFC Central with the Steelers in and were division rivals for seasons The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups However since the franchise moved to Tennessee in the rivalry shifted with the Titans winning of meetings including a bitter playoff showdown in the Titans won seven in a row in the period the longest win streak by either team in the series The Steelers have won of career meetings following their win at Nissan Stadium in Denver Broncos The Denver Broncos in broke a tie with the Oakland Raiders for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland s six The Steelers rivalry with the Broncos dates from but the

ended in a tie Denver s first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the divisional round the Broncos won The following year the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver in the divisional round Their next playoff matchup was the divisional round in Mile High Stadium the Steelers pulled the upset They nearly pulled the upset again years later in Denver but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff In the two teams met in Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game where Denver squeaked out at win Eight years later the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL by beating Denver in Colorado In after appearing in Super Bowl XLV the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as AFC Champions dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the Tim Tebow led Broncos in January in what would become known as the game The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver in Peyton Manning s debut as Broncos quarterback The two clubs met twice in as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs through the season Denver leads the series including in the playoffs Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row In their last matchup the Steelers beat the Broncos on October in Pittsburgh by the score of Las Vegas Raiders The Steelers rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the s and early to mid s The Steelers first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders which occurred on December in a victory over the Raiders the victory occurred when Terry Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John Fuqua that was deflected into the hands of Franco Harris who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown which was later referred to as the Immaculate Reception while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game The following year the two teams met in the Divisional Round again and the Raiders responded with a victory to advance to the AFC title game However Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in and to reach the Super Bowl Oakland responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship game the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams but not before Chuck Noll referred to Oakland s George Atkinson as part of the NFL s criminal element after his alleged cheap shot on Lynn Swann during a regular season matchup Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Noll but lost Following the regular season the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury While the rivalry has dissipated over the years mostly due to Oakland s decline after the teams have had notable games against each other including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs and an upset Raiders victory in week of the NFL season which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth In Week of the season another Raiders upset victory happened the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB Bruce Gradkowski s third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go The loss cost the Steelers another playoff run The teams met at Pittsburgh in where the Steelers blew out the Raiders and ended their game winning streak the game was further notable for a punch thrown by Richard Seymour of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in and erased a gap to win The two clubs met again in and the Raiders won again In the Steelers defeated the Raiders at Heinz Field In their most recent matchups the Raiders defeated the Steelers on December in Oakland which ironically would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth The Raiders won at Pittsburgh September then fell on Christmas Eve at Pittsburgh on a last minute touchdown by rookie Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett A lifeless performance in a loss at Vegas September contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach Josh McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler Inter Conference Dallas Cowboys The Steelers once took part in a historic rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys started with the Cowboys first game as a franchise in against the Steelers at the Cotton Bowl with the Steelers coming away with a victory These teams hold a record for the most times three that two teams have met in a Super Bowl The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIII The Cowboys never won a regular season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers Between the Cowboys and Steelers Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating which as of numbered players and nine coaches front office including Ernie Stautner defensive

game s final score Steelers Cowboys The Cowboys won on December at Cowboys Stadium by a margin in overtime and won at Heinz Field on November The all time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys The Pittsburgh Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the film Black Sunday parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X Most recently the Steelers beat the Cowboys by a margin Philadelphia Eagles The Philadelphia Eagles and Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in From that season through this was a major rivalry for both teams as both were part of the same division In they were placed in separate divisions but remained in the same conference for three years In the Steelers along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts moved to the American Football Conference while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old line NFL teams in the National Football Conference As a result the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year instead they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season The most recent meeting was in at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before with the Eagles winning The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to which was also the start of the Super Bowl era The Eagles lead the all
