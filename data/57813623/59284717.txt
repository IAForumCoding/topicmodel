The Epic Games Store is a video game digital distribution service and storefront operated by Epic Games It launched in December as a software client for Microsoft Windows and macOS and online storefront The service provides friends list management game matchmaking and other features Epic Games has further plans to expand the feature set of the storefront but it does not plan to add as many features as other digital distribution platforms such as discussion boards or user reviews instead using existing social media platforms to support these Epic began offering digital distribution for game publishers after the success of Fortnite released in which Epic distributed using their own software channels to players on Windows and macOS systems Tim Sweeney founder and CEO of Epic Games stated in August that the revenue cut of Steam the dominant game storefront from Valve was unreasonably high at and suggested that they could run a profitable store with as little as an cut By launch Epic Games had settled on a revenue cut for titles published through the store as well as dropping the licensing fees for games built on their Unreal Engine normally of the revenue Epic Games enticed developers and publishers to the service by offering them time exclusivity agreements to publish on the storefront in exchange for guaranteed minimum revenue Epic also offered users one or two free games each week for the first five years of its operation to help draw users Criticism from users has been drawn to Epic Games and those developers and publishers opting for exclusivity deals asserting that these are segmenting the market Storefront and software The Epic Games Store is a storefront for games available via the web and built into Epic Games launcher application Both web and application allow players to purchase games while through the launcher the player can install and keep their games up to date Epic s newer games will be exclusively available through its store and the company plans to fund developers to release exclusively through their store using revenue guarantees to developers that opt for this with Epic paying the difference should a game underperform For other developers Epic takes a share of revenue the rest going to the developer and for any games developed using the Unreal Engine Epic forgoes the revenue based fee for those games sold through their storefront After paying for content delivery and other services Epic s profit is about of gross revenue though with economies of scale this could increase to By Epic s calculations the storefront s commission was sufficient to be profitable Epic planned to offer one free game every two weeks through this was increased to one free game every week in June and on weeks where the free game had a mature content rating and thus locked out if parental controls are enabled Epic offered a second free game not so rated Epic since affirmed that they planned to continue the free game program through and Later it was announced the program would continue through and beyond Through the first eighteen months of this program Epic had given out over two thousand dollars of games as estimated by PCGamesN Certain free game offerings had been highly popular in its giveaway for Grand Theft Auto V in May more than seven millions new users claimed the giveaway in addition to existing ones and temporarily crashed Epic s servers and later over million users obtained a free copy of Star Wars Battlefront II offered in January with the new influx of players crashing the game s servers briefly Documents unveiled during the Epic Games v Apple trial in showed that in the store s giveaways prior to Epic paid buyouts to the developers of the free game ranging typically from to million and measured this performance in new users drawn to the storefront on the order of new users with that buyout averaging from to per new user Epic Games also has offered sales in which Epic absorbs the discount from the sale For example its first store wide sale in May offered a discount of US off any game valued at US or more The store at launch had barebones set of features but Epic plans to develop feature subsets comparable to other digital storefronts Eventually the storefront will offer user reviews but this feature will be opt in by developers to avoid misuse by activities like review bombing Cloud saving was added in August while preliminary support for achievements and user modifications were added in July Full support for achievements were rolled out in October There are no plans to include internal user forums The storefront will include a ticket based support system for users to report bugs and technical problems for games to developers while developers will be encouraged to link to external forums and social channels of their choosing like Reddit and Discord in lieu of storefront tied forums However a party chat system similar to features of Discord will be implemented in to allow friends to chat while in games supported by the store Information taken from OpenCritic was added to product Store pages in January to provide users with critical review information The store added a review system in June and as to fight review bombing the system is based on randomized polling of users and with presentation of random subsets of these reviews to storefront pages The store does not have features such as virtual reality headset support nor is expected to have any game shaped features similar to Steam s trading cards designed to drive sales Cloud saving was introduced on a very limited game by game basis in July though Epic plans to expand this out after validating the feature In December Epic gave developers and publishers the option to implement their own in game storefront for microtransactions and other purchases for a game while still retaining the option to use the Epic storefront instead Where possible Epic plans to extend its Support a Creator program that it had launched in Fortnite Battle Royale to other games offered on the store With the Support a Creator program players can opt to indicate a streamer or content creator selected by Epic based on submitted applications to support Supported streamers then receive revenue from Epic Games on microtransactions made through the Epic Games Store from the players that supported them incentivizing these content creators within Fortnite creators had received about of the cash value of the microtransactions Following developers discovering that Valve would not allow games on Steam that used blockchain based elements like cryptocurrency or non fungible tokens as these items have value outside of Steam Epic announced that they would allow such games though this remains part of the review of each game that Epic performs before accepting a game onto its system History Digital distribution of games for personal computers prior to the introduction of the Epic Games Store was through digital storefronts like Steam and GOG com with Steam being the dominant channel with an estimated of all digital distribution in Valve which operated Steam took a revenue cut of all games sold through their services a figure matched by the other services like GOG com and console and mobile storefronts In August Epic s Tim Sweeney suggested that was no longer a reasonable cut and that Valve could still profit if they cut their revenue share to In early December Epic Games announced that it would open a digital storefront to challenge Steam by using a revenue split rather than Steam s Epic also said that it would not impose digital rights management DRM restrictions on games sold through its platform The store opened days later on December as part of the Game Awards with a handful of games and a short list of upcoming titles The store was open for macOS and Windows platforms before expanding to Android and other platforms Epic aims to release a storefront for Android devices bypassing the Google Play Store where it will similarly only take a cut compared to Google s While Apple Inc s monopoly on iOS currently makes it impossible for Epic to release an App Store there analysts believe that if Google reacts to Epic s App Store by reducing their cut Apple will be pressured to follow suit Epic has tried to ask Google for an exemption to bypass Google s payment systems for in app purchases for the Fortnite Battle Royale app but Google has refused to allow this Prior to the store s launch its Director of Publishing Strategy Sergey Galyonkin had run Steam Spy a website that collected Steam usage data from public profiles to create public sales statistics He ran the site as a side project but used it to learn what developers would want from Epic s store namely fewer social elements and less visual clutter The store s contents were hand curated until Epic opened the store to self publishing starting with a beta of these features in August Epic s staff will still need to approve games for the store a process that mostly focus es on the technical side of things and general quality according to Tim Sweeney Sweeney does not expect this vetting process to be as stringent as the approvals needed to publish games on home video game consoles but will use human evaluation to filter out bloatware and asset flips among other poor quality titles Epic does not plan to allow adults only mature content on the store In January Ubisoft announced its plans to distribute its games via the Epic Games Store with its upcoming Tom Clancy s The Division to be sold on the storefront in addition to Ubisoft s own Uplay storefront instead of Steam making it the first major third party publisher to utilize the Epic Games Store Ubisoft said that selecting the Epic Games Store for future games was part of a larger business discussion related to Steam Chris Early Ubisoft s vice president for partnerships and revenue described Steam as unrealistic the current business model that they have It doesn t reflect where the world is today in terms of game distribution Publisher Deep Silver followed suit later that month announcing that Metro Exodus will be exclusive to Epic Games Store for one year at a reduced US in North America compared to US when it was offered on other storefronts Epic has subsequently made partnerships with Private Division and Quantic Dream for publishing on the store The storefront started offering non game applications in December with the introduction of Spotify Epic stated that it will not take a cut of any of Spotify s subscriptions for those using it via its storefront app Other apps added included itch io iHeartRadio Krita and Brave Epic introduced cabined accounts intended for children in December These accounts have access to certain free games on the store including Fortnite Fall Guys and Rocket League with limited gameplay features to provide a safe environment for children These accounts also cannot purchase games without the authority of a parent s approval as well as other parental controls Epic added self publishing options to the store in March Similar to Steam Direct a developer pays to list their game Epic does some minimum oversight of these games disallowing pornographic titles and those with multiplayer but lacking cross platform play support for the game on other storefronts In May Epic announced a reward program in which users can earn in currency for eligible purchases A First Run Program offering developers to waive Epic s revenue share during months store exclusivity was announced on August Additionally a Now on Epic program offering developers the same conditions for previously released games was announced on October Reception The Epic Games Store was announced a few days after Valve had revealed a change in the Steam revenue sharing model that reduced Valve s take reducing their revenue cut from to after a game made more than US million and to after US million Several indie game developers expressed concern that this change was meant to help keep larger AAA developers and publishers and did little to support smaller developers As such when the Epic Games Store was announced several journalists saw it as potentially disruptive to Steam s current model Some developers and publishers have announced plans to release games that they were planning to release through Steam now exclusively through the Epic Games Store or to have timed exclusivity on Epic s storefront before appearing on other services Valve s Gabe Newell welcomed the competition saying it is awesome for everybody It keeps us honest it keeps everybody else honest but did comment that in the short term the competition was ugly Over its first year in Epic reported that the Store drew million customers and brought in over US million in sales with US million being spent on third party games Of those third party games of the sales came from the Epic Games Store s time limited exclusives Overall Epic stated that overall sales were higher than they had anticipated For Epic stated the store had reached million players million daily active players and annual sales over US million US million of that for third party titles According to data collected by Simon Carless in of the first wave of Epic storefront exclusive games in only Satisfactory had surpassed what Epic paid for that exclusivity and it along with Dauntless are the only two games expected to make a profit for Epic By total revenue from the store was million with million users Reactions to storefront exclusivity To compete against Steam Epic Games has frequently arranged for time exclusive releases of games on the Epic Games Store before other storefronts typically for either six months or a year Sweeney stated that this strategy was the only way to challenge Steam s dominant position and would stop seeking exclusivity should Valve reduce its revenue share Otherwise Epic will continue to accept offers for exclusivity on the Epic Games Store from any developers or publishers that are interested regardless of what prior plans they had made with Steam or other storefronts Some consumers have reacted negatively towards these exclusivity deals as it appears to create division in the gaming community similar to games that are released with timed exclusivity on home consoles Metro Exodus by developers A Games and published by Deep Silver had been planned as a Steam release However Deep Silver announced a few weeks before release that the game would be a timed exclusive on the Epic Games Store eventually available on Steam a year after release Some users were upset by this review bombing the game on Steam and complaining at A Games Deep Silver backed up A Games and noted the decision for Epic Games Store exclusivity was made by Deep Silver s parent Koch Media In the days that followed after Metro Exodus release players used the Steam review system to praise the game as Epic Games Store lacked user reviews at that time Phoenix Point a spiritual successor to X COM by X COM lead designer Julian Gollop was successfully crowdfunded with players given the option of redemption keys on Steam or GOG com In March Gollop announced that they have opted to make Phoenix Point exclusive to the Epic Games Store for a year backers would get a redemption key for the Epic Games Store as well as for Steam or GOG a year later when the exclusivity period was up as well as being provided the first year s downloadable content for free Gollop explained that with the exclusivity deal his team received additional financial support to finish up Phoenix Point Several backers were angered by this decision believing that Gollop s team used their funds to get the game to a point where they could get external investment and then change the direction of the game Gollop asserted that the deal with Epic Games did not alter Phoenix Point s ultimate direction but did offer full refunds to backers if they wanted Glumberland the developers of Ooblets announced that the game would be exclusive to the Epic Games Store in late July citing that Epic s funding support would help to keep the studio afloat until release and provide them a better revenue split In the announcement by Glumberland s Ben Wasser he included what he felt had been joking language related to criticisms of Epic Games Store exclusivity calling those who complained immature toxic gamers but that the situation was nothing to get worked up about In the wake of this Wasser and others at Glumberland began to receive thousands of hostile negative messages related to the announcement including threats Wasser had not expected the community to react to the message that way and tried to clarify Glumberland s position of needing Epic s support rather than any attempt to spurn the gaming community Sweeney spoke later that the campaign against Ooblets represents a growing trend in the community based on the coordinated and deliberate creation and promotion of false information including fake screenshots videos and technical analysis accompanied by harassment of partners promotion of hateful themes and intimidation of those with opposing views Sweeney said that Epic is working with its partners and developers to try to improve the situation and support those targeted in such manners Further issues on exclusivity arose after Unfold Games who were in the final stages of preparing to release their game Darq reported on their interactions with Epic Games Darq had been established as a Steam release for several months and the developers announced that they were nearing release in According to Unfold Games Epic Games approached them about having the game on the Epic Games Store in addition to providing funding support However when asked Epic Games clarified that Unfold would have to sell the game on the Epic Games Store exclusively having to withdraw the game from Steam for a period of one year Unfold decided against going with Epic Games noting that a large part of their marketing for fundraising was a major emphasis on releasing on Steam as well as due to the game having been wishlisted by a large number of Steam users As a result of media attention regarding Epic Games Store Unfold released Darq as a digital rights management free game on Steam and GOG com Some journalists have expressed concern that Epic s large focus on exclusivity may harm their intent Following a number of other time exclusive planned releases on the Epic Games Store announced during the Game Developers Conference and further complaints from players about this Steve Allison head of the storefront division admitted that they did not want to cause such disruption in the gaming community According to Allison they will try to avoid making such large scale exclusivity deals so close to a game s release and want to try to respect what the community wants Following similar complaints from backers of Shenmue III who were upset about the Steam release being delayed Epic Games announced that with Shenmue III and any future crowd funded game that ends up with Epic Games Store exclusivity it will cover the costs of any refund requests from backers Other criticisms In April in the Epic Games v Apple lawsuit Apple submitted a court filing that claimed that the Epic Games Store was running at a significant loss and likely would not be profitable until based on deposition from Epic s financial management and thus requiring Epic to assure revenue from its other product streams Apple asserted that Epic had lost around million on the store from to primarily due to the minimum guarantees it provides to developers for bringing their game to the store and from its storefront exclusivity deals In its response to Apple s claim Epic stated it expected the Epic Games Store to become profitable by and that it was not yet profitable because it has front loaded its marketing and user acquisition costs to gain market share Sweeney in response to this claim via Twitter stated that the store has proven to be a fantastic success in reaching gamers with great games and a fantastic investment into growing the business In March PC Gamer discovered that on select laptop configurations Epic Games Store can shorten battery lifespan by up to even when it is not used Epic Games Store window is closed and application is minimized to tray On most devices this impact is milder at only References External links Media related to Epic Games Store at
