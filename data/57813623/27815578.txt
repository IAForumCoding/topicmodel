Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios The game was created by Markus Notch Persson in the Java programming language Following several early private testing versions it was first made public in May before being fully released on November with Notch stepping down and Jens Jeb Bergensten taking over development Minecraft has become the best selling video game in history with over million copies sold and nearly million monthly active players as of Over the years following its release it has been ported to several platforms including PC mobile and various consoles In Minecraft players explore a blocky pixelated procedurally generated three dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain Players can discover and extract raw materials craft tools and items and build structures earthworks and machines Depending on their chosen game mode players can fight hostile mobs as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world Game modes include a survival mode in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health creative mode in which players have unlimited resources and the ability to fly spectator mode in which players can fly go through blocks and enter the bodies of other players and entities adventure mode in which players have to survive without being able to build and place blocks and hardcore mode in which the difficulty is set to Hard and dying causes the player to lose their ability to play on that world The game s large community also offers a wide variety of user generated content such as modifications servers skins texture packs and custom maps which add new game mechanics and possibilities Minecraft has received critical acclaim winning several awards and being cited by some as one of the greatest video games ever created social media parodies adaptations merchandise and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry computer aided design and computer science In Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US billion Several spin offs have also been made including Minicraft Minecraft Story Mode Minecraft Earth Minecraft Dungeons and Minecraft Legends In addition a live action film of the same name is scheduled for a theatrical release in Gameplay Minecraft is a D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game However there is an achievement system known as advancements in the Java Edition of the game trophies on the PlayStation ports and achievements in Bedrock Edition and the Xbox ports Gameplay is in the first person perspective by default but players have the option of a third person perspective The game world is composed of rough D objects mainly cubes and fluids and commonly called blocks representing various materials such as dirt stone ores tree trunks known as Logs water and lava The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects These blocks are arranged in a D grid while players can move freely around the world Players can mine blocks and then place them elsewhere enabling them to build things Many commentators have described the game s physics system as unrealistic The game also contains a material called redstone which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices electrical circuits and logic gates allowing for the construction of many complex systems The game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation or manually specified by the player There are limits on vertical movement but Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane Due to technical issues when extremely distant locations are reached however there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations beyond million blocks from the center The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller by sections called chunks that are only created or loaded when players are nearby The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields the terrain includes plains mountains forests caves and bodies of water or lava The in game time system follows a day and night cycle with one full cycle lasting for real time minutes When starting a new world players must choose one of five game modes as well as one of four difficulties ranging from Peaceful to Hard Increasing the difficulty of the game causes the player to take more damage from mobs non player characters as well as having other difficulty specific effects For example the Peaceful difficulty prevents hostile mobs from spawning and the Hard difficulty allows players to starve to death if their hunger bar is depleted Once selected the difficulty can be changed but the game mode is locked and can only be changed with cheats New players are given a randomly selected default character skin out of possibilities including Steve or Alex but the option to create custom skins was made available in Players encounter various mobs such as animals villagers and hostile creatures Passive mobs such as cows pigs and chickens can be hunted for food and crafting materials They spawn in the daytime while hostile mobs including large spiders witches creepers skeletons endermen and zombies spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves Some hostile mobs such as zombies skeletons and drowned underwater versions of zombies burn under the sun if they have no headgear Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the creeper an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player and the enderman a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions for example zombies have husk and drowned variants that spawn in deserts and oceans respectively Dimensions Minecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the Overworld the main world the Nether and the End The Nether The Nether is a hell like underworld dimension accessed via either a player built obsidian portal or one of the Ruined Portals randomly generated throughout the world It contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the Overworld due to every block traveled in the Nether being equivalent to blocks traveled in the Overworld Water cannot exist in the Nether except if placed in a cauldron The Nether is mainly populated by pigman like mobs called piglins and their zombified counterparts zombified piglins plus floating balloon like mobs called ghasts The piglins are considered particularly noteworthy because of their bartering system where the player can give them gold ingots and receive items in return The player can also build an optional boss mob called The Wither out of materials found in the Nether The End The End is reached by underground portals in the Overworld It consists of islands floating above a dark bottomless void A boss enemy called the Ender Dragon guards the largest central island Killing the dragon opens access to an exit portal which when entered cues the game s ending credits and the End Poem a roughly word work written by Irish novelist Julian Gough which takes about nine minutes to scroll past and is the game s only narrative text and only text of significant length directed at the player At the conclusion of the credits the player is teleported back to their respawn point and may continue the game indefinitely Game modes Survival mode In survival mode players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items Depending on the difficulty monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character requiring players to build a shelter at night The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs falls drowning falling into lava suffocation starvation and other events Players also have a hunger bar which must be periodically refilled by eating food in game except in peaceful difficulty If the hunger bar is depleted automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty Players can craft a wide variety of items in Minecraft Craftable items include armor which mitigates damage from attacks weapons such as swords or axes which allows monsters and animals to be killed more easily and tools such as pickaxes or hoes which break certain types of blocks more quickly Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them with higher tier items being more effective and durable Players can construct furnaces which can cook food process ores and convert materials into other materials Players may also exchange goods with a villager NPC through a trading system which involves trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa The game has an inventory system allowing players to carry a limited number of items Upon dying items in the players inventories are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so Players then re spawn at their spawn point which by default is where players first spawn in the game and can be reset by sleeping in a bed in the overworld or using a respawn anchor in the Nether Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they disappear or despawn after minutes Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players mining smelting ores breeding animals and cooking food Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools armor and weapons Enchanted items are generally more powerful last longer or have other special effects Creative mode In creative mode players have access to nearly all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu and can place or remove them instantly Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will and their characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger The game mode helps players focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance Other game modes Minecraft includes other game modes such as spectator mode which allows players to fly through blocks Hardcore mode is a survival mode variant in which upon death the player may only view the world in spectator mode or return to the game s menu Adventure mode is a survival mode variant with possible restrictions added by a creator of a map Multiplayer Multiplayer in Minecraft enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world It is available through direct game to game multiplayer LAN play local split screen console only and servers player hosted and business hosted Players can run their own servers use a hosting provider or connect directly to another player s game via Xbox Live Single player worlds have local area network support allowing players to join a world on locally interconnected computers without a server setup Minecraft multiplayer servers are guided by server operators who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players Operators can also set up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed or disallowed to enter the server Multiplayer servers have a wide range of activities with some servers having their own unique rules and customs The largest and most popular server is Hypixel which has been visited by over million unique players Player versus player combat PvP can be enabled to allow fighting between players Many servers have custom plugins that allow actions that are not normally possible Minecraft Realms In Mojang announced Minecraft Realms a server hosting service intended to enable players to run server multiplayer games easily and safely without having to set up their own Unlike a standard server only invited players can join Realms servers and these servers do not use IP addresses Minecraft Java Edition Realms server owners can invite up to twenty people to play on their server with up to ten players online at a time Minecraft Realms server owners can invite up to people to play on their server with up to ten players online at one time The Minecraft Java Edition Realms servers do not support user made plugins but players can play custom Minecraft maps Minecraft Realms servers support user made add ons resource packs behavior packs and custom Minecraft maps At Electronic Entertainment Expo support for cross platform play between Windows iOS and Android platforms was added through Realms starting in June with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch support to come later in and support for virtual reality devices On July Mojang released the beta version of the update allowing cross platform play Nintendo Switch support for Realms was released in July Customization The modding community consists of fans users and third party programmers Using a variety of application program interfaces that have arisen over time they have produced a wide variety of downloadable content for Minecraft such as modifications texture packs and custom maps Modifications of the Minecraft code called mods add a variety of gameplay changes ranging from new blocks items and mobs to entire arrays of mechanisms The modding community is responsible for a substantial supply of mods from ones that enhance gameplay such as mini maps waypoints and durability counters to ones that add to the game elements from other video games and media While a variety of mod frameworks were independently developed by reverse engineering the code Mojang has also enhanced vanilla Minecraft with official frameworks for modification allowing the production of community created resource packs which alter certain game elements including textures and sounds Players can also create their own maps custom world save files which often contain specific rules challenges puzzles and quests and share them for others to play Mojang added an adventure mode in August and command blocks in October which were created specially for custom maps in Java Edition Data packs introduced in version of the Java Edition allow further customization including the ability to add new advancements dimensions functions loot tables predicates recipes structures tags world generation settings and biomes The Xbox Edition supported downloadable content which was available to purchase via the Xbox Games Store these content packs usually contained additional character skins It later received support for texture packs in its twelfth title update while introducing mash up packs which combined texture packs with skin packs and changes to the game s sounds music and user interface The first mash up pack and by extension the first texture pack for the Xbox Edition was released on September and was themed after the Mass Effect franchise Unlike Java Edition however the Xbox Edition did not support player made mods or custom maps A cross promotional resource pack based on the Super Mario franchise by Nintendo was released for the Wii U Edition worldwide on May A mash up pack based on Fallout was announced for release on the Wii U Edition In April malware was discovered in several downloadable user made Minecraft skins for use with the Java Edition of the game Avast stated that nearly accounts were infected and when activated the malware would attempt to reformat the user s hard drive Mojang promptly patched the issue and released a statement stating that the code would not be run or read by the game itself and would only run when the image containing the skin itself was opened In June Mojang released an update known as the Discovery Update to the Bedrock version of the game The update includes a new map a new game mode the Marketplace a catalogue of user generated content that gives Minecraft creators another way to make a living from the game and more Development Before coming up with Minecraft Markus Notch Persson was a game developer with King through March at the time serving mostly browser games during which he learnt a number of different programming languages He would prototype his own games during his off hours at home often based on inspiration he found from other games and participated frequently on the TIGSource forums for independent developers One of these personal projects was called RubyDung a base building game inspired by Dwarf Fortress but as an isometric three dimensional game like RollerCoaster Tycoon He had already made a D texture mapper for another zombie game prototype he had started to try to emulate the style of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars Among the features in RubyDung he explored was a first person view similar to Dungeon Keeper but at the time felt the graphics were too pixelated and omitted this mode Around March Persson left King and joined jAlbum but otherwise kept working on his prototypes Infiniminer a block based open ended mining game first released in April sparked Persson s inspiration for how to take RubyDung forward Infiniminer heavily influenced the visual style of gameplay including bringing back the first person mode the blocky visual style and the block building fundamentals However unlike Infiniminer Persson wanted Minecraft to have RPG elements The original edition of Minecraft now known as the Java Edition was first developed in May Persson released a test video on YouTube of an early version of Minecraft The base program of Minecraft was completed by Persson over a weekend in that month and a private testing was released on TigIRC on May The game was first released to the public on May as a developmental release on TIGSource forums Persson updated the game based on feedback from the forums This version later became known as the Classic version Further developmental phases dubbed as Survival Test Indev and Infdev were released in and The first major update dubbed Alpha was released on June Although Persson maintained a day job with Jalbum net at first he later quit in order to work on Minecraft full time as sales of the alpha version of the game expanded Persson continued to update the game with releases distributed to users automatically These updates included new items new blocks new mobs survival mode and changes to the game s behavior e g how water flows To back the development of Minecraft Persson set up a video game company Mojang with the money earned from the game Mojang co founders included Jakob Porser one of Persson s coworkers from King and Carl Manneh jAlbum s CEO On December Persson announced that Minecraft was entering its beta testing phase on December He further stated that bug fixes and all updates leading up to and including the release would still be free Over the course of the development Mojang hired several new employees to work on the project Mojang moved the game out of beta and released the full version on November On December Jens Jeb Bergensten took full creative control over Minecraft replacing Persson as lead designer On February Mojang announced that they had hired the developers of the popular Bukkit developer API for Minecraft to improve Minecraft s support of server modifications This acquisition also included Mojang apparently taking full ownership of the CraftBukkit server mod which enables the use of Bukkit although the validity of this claim was questioned due to its status as an open source project with many contributors licensed under the GNU General Public License and Lesser General Public License On September Microsoft announced a billion deal to buy Mojang along with the ownership of the Minecraft intellectual property The deal was suggested by Persson when he posted a tweet asking a corporation to buy his share of the game after receiving criticism for enforcing terms in the game s end user license agreement EULA which had been present in the EULA in the prior three years According to Persson Mojang CEO Carl Manneh received a call from a Microsoft executive shortly after the tweet asking if Persson was serious about a deal Mojang was also approached by other companies including Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts The deal with Microsoft was arbitrated on November and led to Persson becoming one of Forbes World s Billionaires Since the first full release of Minecraft dubbed the Adventure Update the game has been continuously updated with many major updates available for free to users who have already purchased the game Early updates frequently introduced gameplay altering mechanics while more recent updates tend to enhance the game through additional content or tweaks to existing features The most recent major update to the game was Tricky Trials which released in June and added new creatures biomes and items The original version of the game was renamed to Minecraft Java Edition on September to separate it from Bedrock Edition which was renamed to just Minecraft by the Better Together Update The Bedrock Edition has also been regularly updated with these updates now matching the themes of Java Edition updates Other versions of the game such as the various console editions and Pocket Edition were either merged into Bedrock or discontinued and as such have not received further updates On April a beta version of Minecraft implementing physically based rendering ray tracing and DLSS was released by Nvidia on RTX enabled GPUs The final version was released on December On April the Xbox One version of the game was enhanced for Xbox Series X S adding K support and the option for higher view distances on Microsoft s newer consoles A native version of Minecraft for PlayStation with the same enhancements as the Xbox Series X S versions was announced on June with a preview available for users following shortly after the announcement Minecraft Pocket Edition In August Minecraft Pocket Edition was released for the Xperia Play on the Android Market as an early alpha version It was then released for several other compatible devices on October An iOS version of Minecraft was released on November A port was made available for Windows Phones shortly after Microsoft acquired Mojang The port concentrates on the creative building and the primitive survival aspect of the game and did not contain all the features of the PC release On his Twitter account Jens Bergensten said that the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is written in C and not Java due to iOS not being able to support Java However there now exists a way to play Java Edition on both Android and iOS devices On December a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone In January Microsoft announced that it would no longer maintain the Windows Phone versions of Pocket Edition On December the full version of Minecraft Pocket Edition was released on iOS Android and Windows Phone Pocket Edition was remade into the

Editions An Xbox version of the game developed by J Studios was released on May On March it was announced that Minecraft would be the flagship game in a new Xbox Live promotion called Arcade NEXT The game differs from the home computer versions in a number of ways including a newly designed crafting system the control interface in game tutorials split screen multiplayer and the ability to play with friends via Xbox Live The worlds in the Xbox version are also not infinite and are essentially barricaded by invisible walls The Xbox version was originally similar in content to older PC versions but was gradually updated to bring it closer to the current PC version prior to its discontinuation An Xbox One version featuring larger worlds among other enhancements was released on September Versions of the game for the PlayStation and PlayStation were released on December and September respectively The PlayStation version was announced as a launch title though it was eventually

Minecraft K and a version for the Raspberry Pi Minecraft for Windows Minecraft for Windows is exclusive to Microsoft s Windows and Windows operating systems The beta release for Windows launched on the Windows Store on July After nearly one and a half years in beta Microsoft fully released Minecraft for Windows on December Called the Ender Update this release implemented new features to this

single title for purchase those who owned one version would automatically gain access to the other version Both game versions would otherwise remain separate Minecraft K Minecraft K is a simplified version of Minecraft similar to the Classic version that was developed for the Java K Game Programming Contest in way less than kilobytes The map itself is finite composed of blocks and the same world is generated every time Players are restricted to placing or destroying blocks which consist of grass dirt stone wood leaves and brick Minecraft Pi Edition A version of Minecraft for the Raspberry Pi was officially revealed at Minecon The Pi Edition is based on an alpha version of Pocket Edition with the added ability of using text commands to edit the game world Players can open the game code and use the Python programming language to manipulate things in the game world It also includes a scripting API to modify the game and server software for multiplayer The game was leaked on December but was quickly pulled off It was officially released on February Mojang stopped providing updates to Minecraft Raspberry Pi Edition in It is preinstalled on Raspberry Pi OS and can be downloaded for free from the official Minecraft website Music and sound design Minecraft s music and sound effects were produced by German musician Daniel Rosenfeld better known as C To create the sound effects for the game Rosenfeld made extensive use of foley techniques On learning the processes for the game he remarked Foley s an interesting thing and I had to learn its subtleties Early on I wasn t that knowledgeable about it It s a whole trial and error process You just make a sound and eventually you go Oh my God that s it Get the microphone There s no set way of doing anything at all He reminisced on creating the in game sound for grass blocks stating It turns out that to make grass sounds you don t actually walk on grass and record it because grass sounds like nothing What you want to do is get a VHS break it apart and just lightly touch the tape According to Rosenfeld his favorite sound to design for the game was the hisses of spiders He elaborates I like the spiders Recording that was a whole day of me researching what a spider sounds like Turns out there are spiders that make little screeching sounds so I think I got this recording of a fire hose put it in a sampler and just pitched it around until it sounded like a weird spider was talking to you Many sounds for the game were created accidentally or spontaneously On the creation for the sound for the creeper Rosenfeld recalled That was just a complete accident by Markus and me sic We just put in a placeholder sound of burning a matchstick It seemed to work hilariously well so we kept it On other sounds such as those of the zombie Rosenfeld remarked I actually never wanted the zombies so scary I intentionally made them sound comical It s nice to hear that they work so well Rosenfeld remarked that the sound engine was terrible to work with remembering If you had two song files at once it the game engine would actually crash There were so many more weird glitches like that the guys never really fixed because they were too busy with the actual game and not the sound engine The background music in Minecraft is instrumental ambient music To compose the music of Minecraft Rosenfeld used the package from Ableton Live along with several additional plug ins Speaking on them Rosenfeld said They can be pretty much everything from an effect to an entire orchestra Additionally I ve got some synthesizers that are attached to the computer Like a Moog Voyager Dave Smith Prophet and a Virus TI On March Rosenfeld released a soundtrack titled Minecraft Volume Alpha it includes most of the tracks featured in Minecraft as well as other music not featured in the game Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku chose the music in Minecraft as one of the best video game soundtracks of On November Rosenfeld released the second official soundtrack titled Minecraft Volume Beta which includes the music that was added in later versions of the game A physical release of Volume Alpha consisting of CDs black vinyl and limited edition transparent green vinyl LPs was issued by indie electronic label Ghostly International on August On August Ghostly released Volume Beta on CD and vinyl with alternate color LPs and lenticular cover pressings released in limited quantities Rosenfeld s music remained the only music in the game until in The Nether Update had a new composer Lena Raine Since then other composers have made contributions with Raine remaining as the new primary composer such as in Caves Cliffs soundtrack along with Kumi Tanioka The Wild Update soundtrack with Samuel berg and Trails and Tales Soundtrack with the addition of Aaron Cherof s music Ownership of all music besides Rosenfeld s independently released albums has been retained by Microsoft with their label publishing all of the other artists releases Gareth Coker also composed some of the music for the game s mini games from the Legacy Console editions Rosenfeld had stated his intent to create a third album of music for the game in a interview with FACT Magazine and confirmed its existence in a tweet stating that his work on the record as of then had tallied up to be longer than the previous two albums combined which in total clocks in at over hours and minutes However due to licensing issues with Microsoft the third volume has since not seen release On January Rosenfeld was asked in an interview with Anthony Fantano whether or not there was still a third volume of his music intended for release Rosenfeld responded saying I have something I consider it finished but things have become complicated especially as Minecraft is now a big property so I don t know Variants For the tenth anniversary of the game s release Mojang remade a version of Minecraft Classic in JavaScript and made it available to play online It functions much the same as creative mode allowing players to build and destroy any and all parts of the world either alone or in a multiplayer server Environmental hazards such as lava do not damage players and some blocks function differently since their behavior was later changed during development Around prior to Minecraft s full release there had been collaboration between Mojang and The Lego Group to make a Lego brick based Minecraft game to be called Brickcraft This would have modified the base Minecraft game to use Lego bricks which meant adapting the basic block to account for larger pieces typically used in Lego sets Persson had worked on the preliminary version of this game which he had named Project Rex Kwon Do based on the joke from Napoleon Dynamite Lego had greenlit the project to go forward and while Mojang had put two developers on the game for six months they later opted to cancel the project as Mojang felt that the Lego Group were too demanding on what they could do according to Mojang s Daniel Kaplan The Lego Group had considered buying out Mojang to complete the game but at this point Microsoft made its offer to buy the company for over billion According to the Lego Group s Ronny Scherer the company was not yet sure of the potential success of Minecraft at this point and backed off from acquisition after Microsoft brought this offer to Mojang Virtual reality Early on Persson planned to support the Oculus Rift with a port of Minecraft However after Facebook acquired Oculus in he abruptly canceled plans noting Facebook creeps me out A community made modification known as Minecraft VR was developed in to provide virtual reality support to Minecraft Java Edition oriented towards Oculus Rift hardware A fork of the Minecraft VR modification known as Vivecraft ported the mod to OpenVR and is oriented towards supporting HTC Vive hardware On August Microsoft launched official Oculus Rift support for Minecraft on Windows Upon its release the Minecraft VR mod was discontinued by its developer due to trademark complaints issued by Microsoft and Vivecraft was endorsed by the community makers of the Minecraft VR modification due to its Rift support and being superior to the original Minecraft VR mod Also available is a Gear VR version titled Minecraft Gear VR Edition Windows Mixed Reality support was added in On September Mojang Studios announced that the PlayStation version of the game would be getting PlayStation VR support in the same month The only officially supported VR versions of Minecraft are the PlayStation version Minecraft Gear VR Edition and Minecraft for Windows for Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality headsets Reception Critics Early versions of Minecraft received critical acclaim praising the creative freedom it grants players in game as well as the ease of enabling emergent gameplay Critics have praised Minecraft s complex crafting system commenting that it is an important aspect of the

Jaz McDougall of PC Gamer said Minecraft is intuitively interesting and contagiously fun with an unparalleled scope for creativity and memorable experiences It has been regarded as having introduced millions of children to the digital world insofar as its basic game mechanics are logically analogous to computer commands IGN was disappointed about the troublesome steps needed to set up multiplayer

would be changing the Minecraft end user license agreement EULA to prohibit servers from accepting donations or payments in exchange for the donating or paying players receiving in game advantages on such server essentially banning pay to win servers Mojang spokesperson Owen Hill provided examples of what it would and would not allow saying company would allow for pay to play servers in which a player is required to pay a fee to access the server or for cosmetic enhancements such as in game costumes or pets but that Mojang would be cracking down on paying to obtain powerful swords or potions providing a competitive advantage to the player versus other players The new crackdowns were supported by Persson citing him receiving multiple emails from parents of children who had spent hundreds of dollars on servers The Minecraft community and server owners however heavily despised the new change in enforcement and protested en masse which included comparing Mojang to monolithic video game publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision gaming companies often criticized online for their highly restrictive digital rights management and user license agreements Many argued that the crackdown would force smaller servers to close their doors and some blamed the crackdown on Mojang attempting to suppress competition for its own Minecraft Realms subscription service Account migration In Mojang Studios revealed that it would begin the process of requiring that Microsoft accounts be used in order to log into the Java Edition of the game and that older Mojang Studios accounts would be sunsetted The move to Microsoft accounts also required Java Edition players to create Xbox network Gamertags Mojang Studios defended the move to Microsoft accounts by saying that improved security could be offered which included Java accounts being able to use two factor authentication players could block cyberbullies in chat and improve parental controls The community responded with intense backlash against this announcement particularly taking issue to the various technical difficulties encountered in the process and how account migration would be mandatory even for those who do not play on servers As of March Microsoft required that all players migrate in order to access the Java Edition of Minecraft A deadline of September was announced to complete account migration after which all legacy Mojang accounts became inaccessible and unable to be migrated Java Edition chat reporting In June Microsoft and Mojang Studios announced it would be releasing a player reporting feature in all future builds of Java Edition In earlier development builds players could report other players on multiplayer servers for sending messages that are prohibited by the Xbox Live Code of Conduct report categories included profane language substance abuse hate speech threats of violence and nudity though Microsoft in later builds has since excluded the profane language category from the player reporting feature If a player was found to be in violation of Xbox Community Standards the player would be banned from all servers for a specific period of time or permanently The update containing the report feature was released on July Microsoft and Mojang Studios received substantial backlash and protest from community members one of the most common complaints being that banned players would be forbidden from joining any server even private ones Others took issue to what they saw as Microsoft increasing control over its player base and exercising censorship sparking some to dub the version in reference to the novel Nineteen Eighty Four which deals with similar themes of censorship Cultural impact In September The Guardian classified Minecraft as the best video game of the first two decades of the st century and in November Polygon called the game the most important game of the decade in its s decade in review In December Forbes gave Minecraft a special mention in a list of the best video games of the s stating that the game is without a doubt one of the most important games of the last ten years In June Minecraft was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame Minecraft is recognized as one of the first successful games to use an early access model to draw in sales prior to its full release version to help fund development As Minecraft helped to bolster indie game development in the early s it also helped to popularize the use of the early access model in indie game development Social media sites such as YouTube Facebook and Reddit have played a significant role in popularizing Minecraft Research conducted by the University of Pennsylvania s Annenberg School of Communication showed that one third of Minecraft players learned about the game via Internet videos In Minecraft related videos began to gain influence on YouTube often made by commentators The videos usually contain screen capture footage of the game and voice overs Common coverage in the videos includes creations made by players walkthroughs of various tasks and parodies of works in popular culture By May over four million Minecraft related YouTube videos had been uploaded The game would go on to be a prominent fixture within YouTube s gaming scene during the entire s in it was the second most searched term on the entire platform By it was still YouTube s biggest game globally Some popular commentators have received employment at Machinima a gaming video company that owns a highly watched entertainment channel on YouTube The Yogscast is a British company that regularly produces Minecraft videos their YouTube channel has attained billions of views and their panel at Minecon had the highest attendance Other well known YouTube personalities include Jordan Maron who has created many Minecraft parodies including Minecraft Style a parody of the internationally successful single Gangnam Style by South Korean rapper Psy Minecraft s popularity on YouTube was described by Polygon as quietly dominant although in thanks in part to PewDiePie s playthroughs of the game Minecraft experienced a visible uptick in popularity on the platform YouTube later announced that on December that the total amount of Minecraft related views exceeded one trillion since the game s inception in Minecraft has been referenced by other video games such as Torchlight II Team Fortress Borderlands Choplifter HD Super Meat Boy The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim The Binding of Isaac The Stanley Parable FTL Faster Than Light and Super Smash Bros Ultimate the lattermost of which features a downloadable character and stage based on Minecraft It was also referenced by electronic music artist deadmau in his performances The game is also referenced heavily in Informative Murder Porn the second episode of the seventeenth season of the animated television series South Park Applications The possible applications of Minecraft have been discussed extensively especially in the fields of computer aided design CAD and education In a panel at Minecon a Swedish developer discussed the possibility of using the game to redesign public buildings and parks stating that rendering using Minecraft was much more user friendly for the community making it easier to envision the functionality of new buildings and parks In a member of the Human Dynamics group at the MIT Media Lab Cody Sumter said Notch hasn t just built a game He s tricked million people into learning to use a CAD program Various software has been developed to allow virtual designs to be printed using professional D printers or personal printers such as MakerBot and RepRap In September Mojang began the Block by Block project in cooperation with UN Habitat to create real world environments in Minecraft The project allows young people who live in those environments to participate in designing the changes they would like to see Using Minecraft the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern and citizens are invited to enter the Minecraft servers and modify their own neighborhood Carl Manneh Mojang s managing director called the game the perfect tool to facilitate this process adding The three year partnership will support UN Habitat s Sustainable Urban Development Network to upgrade public spaces by Mojang signed Minecraft building community FyreUK to help render the environments into Minecraft The first pilot project began in Kibera one of Nairobi s informal settlements and is in the planning phase The Block by Block project is based on an earlier initiative started in October Mina Kvarter My Block which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town According to Manneh the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture The ideas presented by the citizens were a template for political decisions In April the Danish Geodata Agency generated all of Denmark in fullscale in Minecraft based on their own geodata This is possible because Denmark is one of the flattest countries with the highest point at meters ranking as the country with the th smallest elevation span where the limit in default Minecraft was around meters above in game sea level when the project was completed Taking advantage of the game s accessibility where other websites are censored the non governmental organization Reporters Without Borders has used an open Minecraft server to create the Uncensored Library a repository within the game of journalism by authors from countries including Egypt Mexico Russia Saudi Arabia and Vietnam who have been censored and arrested such as Jamal Khashoggi The neoclassical virtual building was created over about hours by an international team of people Despite its unpredictable nature Minecraft has become a popular game for speedrunning where players time themselves from being dropped into a new world to reaching The End and defeating the Ender Dragon boss Some speedrunners use a combination of mods external programs and debug menus while other runners play the game in a more vanilla or more consistency oriented way Education Minecraft has also been used in educational settings In an educational organization named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing Minecraft into schools The group works with Mojang to make the game affordable and accessible to schools The version of Minecraft through MinecraftEdu includes unique features to allow teachers to monitor the students progress within the virtual world such as receiving screenshots from students to show completion of a lesson In September MinecraftEdu said that approximately students around the world have access to Minecraft through the company A wide variety of educational activities involving the game have been developed to teach students various subjects including history language arts and science For an example one teacher built a world consisting of various historical landmarks for students to learn and explore Another teacher created a large scale representation of an animal cell within Minecraft that student could explore and learn how cell functions work Great Ormond Street Hospital has been recreated in Minecraft and it proposed that patients can use it to virtually explore the hospital before they visit it in real life Minecraft may also prove as an innovation in computer aided design Minecraft offers an outlet of collaboration in design and could have an impact on the industry With the introduction of redstone blocks to represent electrical circuits users have been able to build functional virtual computers within Minecraft Such virtual creations include a working hard drive an bit virtual computer and even a smaller scale version of Minecraft that is playable and able to be built completely in survival mode with no external modifications In at least one instance a mod has been created to use this feature to teach younger players how to program within a language set by a virtual computer within a Minecraft world Another computational mechanic in Minecraft is the command block a block that is only accessible in creative mode and can alter game logic It has been used to create emulators for the Atari including one by YouTube personality SethBling and the Game Boy Advance In September the British Museum in London announced plans to recreate its building along with all exhibits in Minecraft in conjunction with members of the public Microsoft and the non profit organisation Code org had teamed up to offer Minecraft based games puzzles and tutorials aimed to help teach children how to program by March Microsoft and Code org reported that more than million children have used their tutorials Clones Following the initial surge in popularity of Minecraft in other video games were criticised for having various similarities to Minecraft and some were described as being clones often due to a direct inspiration from Minecraft or only a superficial similarity Examples include Ace of Spades CastleMiner CraftWorld FortressCraft Terraria BlockWorld D Total Miner and Minetest David Frampton designer of The Blockheads reported that one failure of his D game was the low resolution pixel art that too closely resembled the art in Minecraft which resulted in some resistance from fans A homebrew adaptation of the alpha version of Minecraft for the Nintendo DS titled DScraft has been released it has been noted for its similarity to the original game considering the technical limitations of the system In response to Microsoft s acquisition of Mojang and their Minecraft IP various developers announced further clone titles developed specifically for Nintendo s consoles as they were the only major platforms not to officially receive Minecraft at the time These clone titles include UCraft Nexis Games Cube Life Island Survival Cypronia Discovery Noowanda Battleminer Wobbly Tooth Games Cube Creator D Big John Games and Stone Shire Finger Gun Games Despite this the fears of fans were unfounded with official Minecraft releases on Nintendo consoles eventually resuming Markus Persson made another similar game Minicraft for a Ludum Dare competition in Minecon Minecon is the annual official fan convention dedicated to Minecraft The first Minecon was held in November at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas The event included the official launch of Minecraft keynote speeches including one by Persson building and costume contests Minecraft themed breakout classes exhibits by leading gaming and Minecraft related companies commemorative merchandise and autograph and picture times with Mojang employees and well known contributors from the Minecraft community In Minecon was held in person for the last time with the following years featuring annual livestreams instead Notes References
