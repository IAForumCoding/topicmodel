that the service providers do not have the incentives to continue running the servers In such cases the developers of a game might decide to shut down the server permanently Shutting down an online game can severely impact the players Typically a server shutdown means players will no longer be able to play the game For many players this can cause a sense of loss at an emotional level since they often dedicate time and effort to making in game progress e g completing in game tasks to earn items for their characters In some other cases the game might still be playable without the server but certain important functionalities will be lost For example earning key in game items often requires a server that can track each player s progress In some cases an online game may be relaunched in a substantially different form after shutting down in an attempt to increase the game s quality remedy low sales or reverse a declining player base and see significantly greater success Final Fantasy XIV was negatively received upon its release and relaunched as A Realm Reborn in the new version was met with considerable positive reception and is still running as of Splitgate Arena Warfare
