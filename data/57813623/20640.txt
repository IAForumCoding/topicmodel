macOS originally Mac OS X previously shortened as OS X is an operating system developed and marketed by Apple since It is the primary operating system for Apple s Mac computers Within the market of desktop and laptop computers it is the second most widely used desktop OS after Microsoft Windows and ahead of all Linux distributions including ChromeOS Mac OS X succeeded classic Mac OS the primary Macintosh operating system from to Its underlying architecture came from NeXT s NeXTSTEP as a result of Apple s acquisition of NeXT which also brought Steve Jobs back to Apple The first desktop version Mac OS X was released on March All releases from Mac OS X Leopard onward except for OS X Lion are UNIX certified The derivatives of macOS are Apple s other operating systems iOS iPadOS watchOS tvOS and audioOS A prominent part of macOS s original brand identity was the use of Roman numeral X pronounced ten as well as code naming each release after species of big cats and later places within California Apple shortened the name to OS X in and then changed it to macOS in to align with the branding of Apple s other operating systems iOS watchOS and tvOS After sixteen distinct versions of macOS macOS Big Sur was presented as version in and every subsequent version has also incremented the major version number similarly to classic Mac OS and iOS macOS has supported three major processor architectures beginning with PowerPC based Macs in In Apple transitioned to the Intel architecture with a line of Macs using Intel Core processors In Apple began the Apple silicon transition using self designed bit Arm based Apple M series processors on the latest Macintosh computers As of the most recent release of macOS is macOS Sonoma History Development The heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in There the Unix like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed before being launched in The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University with additional kernel layers and low level user space code derived from parts of FreeBSD and other BSD operating systems Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective C programming language Throughout the s Apple had tried to create a next generation OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent Copland and Gershwin projects but all were eventually abandoned This led Apple to acquire NeXT in allowing NeXTSTEP later called OPENSTEP to serve as the basis for Apple s next generation operating system This purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim and then the permanent CEO shepherding the transformation of the programmer friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple s primary market of home users and creative professionals The project was first codenamed Rhapsody before officially being named Mac OS X Mac OS X The letter X in Mac OS X s name refers to the number a Roman numeral and Apple has stated that it should be pronounced ten in this context However it is also commonly pronounced like the letter X The iPhone X iPhone XR and iPhone XS all later followed this convention Previous Macintosh operating systems versions of the classic Mac OS were named using Arabic numerals as with Mac OS and Mac OS Until macOS Big Sur all versions of the operating system were given version numbers of the form x with this going from up until starting with macOS Big Sur Apple switched to numbering major releases with numbers that increase by with every major release The first version of Mac OS X Mac OS X Server was a transitional product featuring an interface resembling the classic Mac OS though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more backward compatibility Mac OS applications could be rewritten to run natively via the Carbon API many could also be run directly through the Classic Environment with a reduction in performance The consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in with Mac OS X Reviews were variable with extensive praise for its sophisticated glossy Aqua interface but criticizing it for sluggish performance With Apple s popularity at a low the maker of FrameMaker Adobe Inc declined to develop new versions of it for Mac OS X Ars Technica columnist John Siracusa who reviewed every major OS X release up to described the early releases in retrospect as dog slow feature poor and Aqua as unbearably slow and a huge resource hog Apple rapidly developed several new releases of Mac OS X Siracusa s review of version Panther noted It s strange to have gone from years of uncertainty and vaporware to a steady annual supply of major new operating system releases Version Tiger reportedly shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows Vista with acceptable performance As the operating system evolved it moved away from the classic Mac OS with applications being added and removed Considering music to be a key market Apple developed the iPod music player and music software for the Mac including iTunes and GarageBand Targeting the consumer and media markets Apple emphasized its new digital lifestyle applications such as the iLife suite integrated home entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser With the increasing popularity of the internet Apple offered additional online services including the Mac MobileMe and most recently iCloud products It later began selling third party applications through the Mac App Store Newer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface moving away from the striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions Some applications began to use a brushed metal appearance or non pinstriped title bar appearance in version In Leopard Apple announced a unification of the interface with a standardized gray gradient window style In the first Intel Macs were released with a specialized version of Mac OS X Tiger A key development for the system was the announcement and release of the iPhone from onwards While Apple s previous iPod media players used a minimal operating system the iPhone used an operating system based on Mac OS X which would later be called iPhone OS and then iOS The simultaneous release of two operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple which cited the iPhone as forcing it to delay Mac OS X Leopard However after Apple opened the iPhone to third party developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X with many iPhone software developers showing interest in Mac development In Mac OS X Leopard was the sole release with universal binary components allowing installation on both Intel Macs and select PowerPC Macs It is also the final release with PowerPC Mac support Mac OS X Snow Leopard was the first version of Mac OS X to be built exclusively for Intel Macs and the final release with bit Intel Mac support The name was intended to signal its status as an iteration of Leopard focusing on technical and performance improvements rather than user facing features indeed it was explicitly branded to developers as being a no new features release Since its release several OS X or macOS releases namely OS X Mountain Lion OS X El Capitan macOS High Sierra and macOS Monterey follow this pattern with a name derived from its predecessor similar to the tick tock model used by Intel In two succeeding versions Lion and Mountain Lion Apple moved some applications to a highly skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS while simplifying some elements by making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use This direction was like brushed metal interfaces unpopular with some users although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility which presented past file versions against a swirling nebula and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow Leopard In addition with Mac OS X Lion Apple ceased to release separate server versions of Mac OS X selling server tools as a separate downloadable application through the Mac App Store A review described the trend in the server products as becoming cheaper and simpler shifting its focus from large businesses to small ones OS X In with the release of OS X Mountain Lion the name of the system was officially shortened from Mac OS X to OS X after the previous version shortened the system name in a similar fashion a year prior That year Apple removed the head of OS X development Scott Forstall and design was changed towards a more minimal direction Apple s new user interface design using deep color saturation text only buttons and a minimal flat interface was debuted with iOS in With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS the version released in OS X Mavericks was something of a transitional release with some of the skeuomorphic design removed while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged The next version OS X Yosemite adopted a design similar to iOS but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse From onwards the system has shifted to an annual release schedule similar to that of iOS and Mac OS X releases prior to Tiger It also steadily cut the cost of updates from Snow Leopard onwards before removing upgrade fees altogether in OS X Mavericks Some journalists and third party software developers have suggested that this decision while allowing more rapid feature release meant less opportunity to focus on stability with no version of OS X recommendable for users requiring stability and performance above new features Apple s update OS X El Capitan was announced to focus specifically on stability and performance improvements macOS In with the release of macOS Sierra the name was changed from OS X to macOS in order to align it with the branding of Apple s other primary operating systems iOS watchOS and tvOS macOS Sierra added Siri iCloud Drive picture in picture support a Night Shift mode that switches the display to warmer colors at night and two Continuity features Universal Clipboard which syncs a user s clipboard across their Apple devices and Auto Unlock which can unlock a user s Mac with their Apple Watch macOS Sierra also adds support for the Apple File System APFS Apple s successor to the dated HFS file system macOS High Sierra released in included performance improvements Metal and HEVC support and made APFS the default file system for SSD boot drives Its successor macOS Mojave was released in adding a dark mode option and a dynamic wallpaper setting It was succeeded by macOS Catalina in which replaces iTunes with separate apps for different types of media and introduces the Catalyst system for porting iOS apps In Apple previewed macOS Big Sur at the WWDC This was the first increment in the primary version number of macOS since the release of Mac OS X Public Beta in updates to macOS were given x numbers matching the version numbering scheme used by Apple s other operating systems Big Sur brought major changes to the UI and was the first version to run on the Arm instruction set The new numbering system was continued in with macOS Monterey with macOS Ventura with macOS Sonoma and with macOS Sequoia Timeline of releases The Power Mac G had special Jaguar builds Tiger did not support bit GUI applications only bit CLI applications bit but not bit PowerPC applications were supported on Intel processors with Rosetta bit Intel applications are supported on Apple silicon Macs with Rosetta However Intel based Macs are unable to run ARM based applications such as iOS and iPadOS apps Architecture At macOS s core is a POSIX compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel which incorporated large parts of FreeBSD kernel and FreeBSD userland for the standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin On top of Darwin Apple layered a number of components including the Aqua interface and the Finder to complete the GUI based operating system which is macOS With its original introduction as Mac OS X the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor the classic Mac OS For example pre emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system s ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other Many aspects of macOS s architecture are derived from OPENSTEP which was designed to be portable to ease the transition from one platform to another For example NeXTSTEP was ported from the original k based NeXT workstations to x and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple and OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project Prior to macOS High Sierra and on drives other than solid state drives SSDs the default file system is HFS which it inherited from the classic Mac OS Operating system designer Linus Torvalds had criticized HFS saying it is probably the worst file system ever whose design is actively corrupting user data He criticized the case insensitivity of file names a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode The Darwin subsystem in macOS manages the file system which includes the Unix permissions layer In and two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions the most common frustration in macOS while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day a process which can take up to minutes More recently another Macworld editor Dan Frakes called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused He argues that macOS typically handles permissions properly without user interference and resetting permissions should only be tried when problems emerge The architecture of macOS incorporates a layered design the layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks Apple provides its own software development tools most prominently an integrated development environment called Xcode Xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including C C Objective C and Swift For the Mac transition to Intel processors it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary which provides compatibility with both the Intel based and PowerPC based Macintosh lines First and third party applications can be controlled programmatically using the AppleScript framework retained from the classic Mac OS or using the newer Automator application that offers pre written tasks that do not require programming knowledge Software compatibility Apple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS Cocoa and Carbon Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten to run natively on Mac OS X The Cocoa API was created as the result of a collaboration between NeXT Computer and Sun Microsystems This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers since the NS prefix is ubiquitous in the framework standing variously for NeXTSTEP or NeXT Sun The official OPENSTEP API published in September was the first to split the API between Foundation and ApplicationKit and the first to use the NS prefix Traditionally Cocoa programs have been mostly written in Objective C with Java as an alternative However on July Apple announced that features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than will not be added to the Cocoa Java programming interface macOS also used to support the Java Platform as a preferred software package in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross platform compatible and that graphical user interfaces written in Swing look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces Since Apple has promoted its new programming language Swift as the preferred language for software development on Apple platforms Apple s original plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers who threatened to abandon the platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite and the idea was shelved To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS to Mac OS X the Carbon Application Programming Interface API was created Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X the little used original release of Mac OS X Server which also did not include the Aqua interface Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards and announced that Carbon applications would not run at bit A number of macOS applications continued to use Carbon for some time afterwards especially ones with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS and for which updates would be difficult uneconomic or not necessary This included Microsoft Office up to Office and Photoshop up to CS Early versions of macOS could also run some classic Mac OS applications through the Classic Environment with performance limitations this feature was removed from onwards and all Macs using Intel processors Because macOS is POSIX compliant many software packages written for the other Unix like systems including Linux can be recompiled to run on it including many scientific and technical programs Third party projects such as Homebrew Fink MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre compiled or pre formatted packages Apple and others have provided versions of the X Window System graphical interface which can allow these applications to run with an approximation of the macOS look and feel The current Apple endorsed method is the open source XQuartz project earlier versions could use the X application provided by Apple or before that the XDarwin project Applications can be distributed to Macs and installed by the user from any source and by any method such as downloading with or without code signing available via an Apple developer account or through the Mac App Store a marketplace of software maintained by Apple through a process requiring the company s approval Apps installed through the Mac App Store run within a sandbox restricting their ability to exchange information with other applications or modify the core operating system and its features This has been cited as an advantage by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system but also as a disadvantage due to blocking the Mac App Store s use for professional applications that require elevated privileges Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer s administrator account Apple produces macOS applications Some are included with macOS and some sold separately This includes iWork Final Cut Pro Logic Pro iLife and the database application FileMaker Numerous other developers also offer software for macOS In Apple introduced an application layer codenamed Marzipan to port iOS apps to macOS macOS Mojave included ports of four first party iOS apps including Home and News and it was announced that the API would be available for third party developers to use from With macOS Catalina in the application layer was made available to third party developers as Mac Catalyst Hardware compatibility List of macOS versions the supported systems on which they run and their RAM requirements Tools such as XPostFacto and patches applied to the installation media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple This includes a number of pre G Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X Jaguar all G based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger and sub MHz G Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac s Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of MHz or greater Except for features requiring specific hardware such as graphics acceleration or DVD writing the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware As most Mac hardware components or components similar to those since the Intel transition are available for purchase some technology capable groups have developed software to install macOS on non Apple computers These are referred to as Hackintoshes a portmanteau of the words hack and Macintosh This violates Apple s EULA and is therefore unsupported by Apple technical support warranties etc but communities that cater to personal users who do not install for resale and profit have generally been ignored by Apple These self made computers allow more flexibility and customization of hardware but at a cost of leaving the user more responsible for their own machine such as on matter of data integrity or security Psystar a business that attempted to profit from selling macOS on non Apple certified hardware was sued by Apple in PowerPC Intel transition In April eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code named Marklar which ran on Intel x processors The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform These rumors subsided until late in May when various media outlets such as The Wall Street Journal and CNET announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months On June Steve Jobs announced in his keynote address at WWDC that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life Intel based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS A new version of Xcode and the underlying command line compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture PowerPC only software is supported with Apple s official binary translation software Rosetta though applications eventually had to be rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and Intel PowerPC binaries suffer a performance penalty when run on Intel Macs through Rosetta Moreover some PowerPC software such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins are not supported on Intel Macs at all Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari so when Safari is running on Intel it requires plug ins that have been compiled as Intel only or universal binaries so PowerPC only plug ins will not work While Intel Macs can run PowerPC Intel and universal binaries PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds Support for the PowerPC platform was dropped following the transition In Apple announced at WWDC that Mac OS X Snow Leopard would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel only Rosetta continued to be offered as an optional download or installation choice in Snow Leopard before it was discontinued with Mac OS X Lion In addition new versions of Mac OS X first and third party software increasingly required Intel processors including new versions of iLife iWork Aperture and Logic Pro Intel Apple silicon transition Rumors of Apple shifting Macs from Intel to in house ARM processors used by iOS devices began circulating as early as and ebbed and flowed throughout the s Rumors intensified in when numerous reports announced that the company would announce its shift to its custom processors at WWDC Apple officially announced its shift to processors designed in house on June at WWDC with the transition planned to last for two years The first release of macOS to support ARM is macOS Big Sur Big Sur and later versions support Universal binaries which are applications consisting of both Intel x and Apple silicon AArch binaries when launched only the appropriate binary is run Additionally Intel binaries can be run on Apple silicon based Macs using the Rosetta binary translation software The transition was completed at WWDC with the announce of the Apple silicon Mac Pro ending the transition in years The change in processor architecture allows Macs with ARM processors to be able to run iOS and iPadOS apps natively Features Aqua user interface One of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua a graphical user interface with water like elements in the first major release of Mac OS X Every window element text graphic or widget is drawn on screen using spatial anti aliasing technology ColorSync a technology introduced many years before was improved and built into the core drawing engine to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals Also drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth New interface elements were integrated including sheets dialog boxes attached to specific windows and drawers which would slide out and provide options The use of soft edges translucent colors and pinstripes similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what Mac OS and Mac OS X Server s Platinum appearance had offered According to Siracusa the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look hit like a ton of bricks Bruce Tognazzini who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group said that the Aqua interface in Mac OS X represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface Third party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance To some extent Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design Apple has continued to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar Since Apple has sold many of its Mac models with high resolution Retina displays and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution independent development on supporting high resolution displays Reviewers have described Apple s support for the technology as superior to that on Windows The human interface guidelines published by Apple for macOS are followed by many applications giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts In addition new services for applications are included which include spelling and grammar checkers special characters palette color picker font chooser and dictionary these global features are present in every Cocoa application adding consistency The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware accelerated drawing This technology introduced in version is called Quartz Extreme a component of Quartz Quartz s internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format PDF imaging model making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices As a side result PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built in features Reflecting its popularity with design users macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre installed font library featuring many prominent brand name designs Components The Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS Quick Look has been part of the Finder since version It allows for dynamic previews of files including videos and multi page documents without opening any other applications Spotlight a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version allows rapid real time searches of data files mail messages photos and other information based on item properties metadata or content macOS makes use of a Dock which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows Apple added Expos in version called Mission Control since version a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop Its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application and hide all windows to access the desktop FileVault is optional encryption of the user s files with the bit Advanced Encryption Standard AES Features introduced in version include Automator an application designed to create an automatic workflow for different tasks Dashboard a full screen group of small applications called desktop widgets that can be called up and dismissed in one keystroke and Front Row a media viewer interface accessed by the Apple Remote Sync Services allows applications to access a centralized extensible database for various elements of user data including calendar and contact items The operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency All system icons are scalable up to pixels as of version to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size including for example the Cover Flow view a three dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes the Finder and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork That version also introduced Spaces a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an Expos like interface an automatic backup technology called Time Machine which allows users to view and restore previous versions of files and application data and Screen Sharing was built in for the first time In more recent releases Apple has developed support for emoji characters by including the proprietary Apple Color Emoji font Apple has also connected macOS with social networks such as Twitter and Facebook through the addition of share buttons for content such as pictures and text Apple has brought several applications and features that originally debuted in iOS its mobile operating system to macOS in recent releases notably the intelligent personal assistant Siri which was introduced in version of macOS Multilingual support There are system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language Recent updates have added increased support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China Updating methods macOS can be updated using the Software Update settings pane in System Settings or the softwareupdate command line utility Until OS X Mountain Lion a separate Software Update application performed this functionality In Mountain Lion and later this was merged into the Mac App Store application although the underlying update mechanism remains unchanged and is fundamentally different from the download mechanism used when purchasing an App Store application In macOS Mojave the updating function was moved again to the Software Update settings pane Most Macs receive six or seven years of macOS updates After a new major release of macOS the previous two releases still receive occasional updates but many security vulnerabilities are only patched in the latest macOS release Release history Mac OS X versions were named after big cats with the exception of Mac OS X Server and the original public beta from Mac OS X until OS X Mavericks when Apple switched to using California locations Prior to its release version was code named internally at Apple as Cheetah and Mac OS X was code named internally as Puma After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X codenamed Jaguar Apple s product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system Mac OS X was marketed as Panther Mac OS X as Tiger Mac OS X as Leopard Mac OS X as Snow Leopard Mac OS X as Lion OS X as Mountain Lion and OS X as Mavericks Panther Tiger and Leopard are registered as trademarks of Apple but Cheetah Puma and Jaguar have never been registered Apple has also registered Lynx and Cougar as trademarks though these were allowed to lapse Computer retailer Tiger Direct sued Apple for its use of the name Tiger On May a US federal court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that Apple s use did not infringe on Tiger Direct s trademark Mac OS X Public Beta On September Apple released a US preview version of Mac OS X internally codenamed Kodiak to gain feedback from users The PB as it was known marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring Mac OS X On March Apple released Mac OS X internally codenamed Cheetah The initial version was slow incomplete and had very few applications available at launch mostly from independent developers While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment for attempts to overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since and delayed by countless setbacks Mac OS X Later that year on September Mac OS X internally codenamed Puma was released It featured increased performance and provided missing features such as DVD playback Apple released as a free upgrade CD for users in addition to the boxed version for people running Mac OS It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS systems by removing a specific file Apple later re released the CDs in an actual stripped down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems On January Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month Mac OS X Jaguar On August Apple followed up with Mac OS X Jaguar the first release to use its code name as part of the branding It brought significant performance improvements and an updated version of Aqua s visual design Jaguar also included over new user facing features including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce MX AGP based video card with at least MB of VRAM a system wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book and the iChat instant messaging client The Happy Mac icon which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence since the original Macintosh was replaced with a grey Apple logo Mac OS X Panther Mac OS X v Panther was released on October It significantly improved performance and incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before including an updated Finder incorporating a brushed metal interface Fast user switching Expos Window manager FileVault Safari iChat AV which added video conferencing features to iChat improved Portable Document Format PDF rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability Support for some early G computers such as beige Power Macs and WallStreet PowerBooks was discontinued Mac OS X Tiger Mac OS X Tiger was released on April Apple stated that Tiger contained more than new features As with Panther certain older machines were no longer supported Tiger requires a Mac with MB and a built in FireWire port Among the new features Tiger introduced Spotlight Dashboard Smart Folders updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes QuickTime Safari Automator VoiceOver Core Image and Core Video The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services On January Apple released the first Intel based Macs along with the update to Tiger This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC based Macs and the new Intel based machines with the exception of the Intel release lacking support for the Classic environment Mac OS X Leopard Mac OS X Leopard was released on October It was called by Apple the largest update of Mac OS X It brought more than new features Leopard supports both PowerPC and Intel x based Macintosh computers support for the G processor was dropped and the G processor required a minimum clock rate of MHz and at least MB of RAM to be installed The single DVD works for all supported Macs including bit machines New features include a new look an updated Finder Time Machine Spaces Boot Camp pre installed full support for bit applications including graphical applications new features in Mail and iChat and a number of new security features Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX registered product on the Intel platform It was also the first BSD based OS to receive UNIX certification Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture Mac OS X Snow Leopard Mac OS X Snow Leopard was released on August Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X Snow Leopard focused on under the hood changes increasing the performance efficiency and stability of the operating system For most users the most noticeable changes were the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X Leopard a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa faster Time Machine backups more reliable and user friendly disk ejects a more powerful version of the Preview application as well as a faster Safari web browser Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs required at least GB of RAM and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC only applications Snow Leopard also featured new bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM improved support for multi core processors through Grand Central Dispatch and advanced GPU performance with OpenCL The update introduced support for the Mac App Store Apple s digital distribution platform for macOS applications OS X Lion OS X Lion was released on July It brought developments made in Apple s iOS such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi touch gestures to the Mac This release removed Rosetta making it incompatible with PowerPC applications Changes made to the GUI include auto hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are used and Mission Control which unifies Expos Spaces Dashboard and full screen applications within a single interface Apple also made changes to applications they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed similar to iOS Documents auto save by default OS X Mountain Lion OS X Mountain Lion was released on July Following the release of Lion the previous year it was the first of the annual rather than two yearly updates to OS X and later macOS which also closely aligned with the annual iOS operating system updates It incorporates some features seen in iOS which include Game Center support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application and Reminders as a to do list app separate from iCal which is renamed as Calendar like the iOS app It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud Notification Center which makes its debut in Mountain Lion is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS and higher Application pop ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine QQ com and com services for Mail Contacts and Calendar Youku Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets Starting with Mountain Lion Apple software updates including the OS are distributed via the App Store This updating mechanism replaced the Apple Software Update utility OS X Mavericks OS X Mavericks was released on October It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a bit Intel processor Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS only Maps and iBooks applications improvements to the Notification Center enhancements to several applications and many under the hood improvements OS X Yosemite OS X Yosemite was released on October It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS intended to feature a more minimal text based flat design with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors Apple s showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff which enables users with iPhones running iOS or later to answer phone calls receive and send SMS messages and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac As of OS X Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture OS X El Capitan OS X El Capitan was released on September Similar to Mac OS X Snow Leopard Apple described this release as emphasizing refinements to the Mac experience and improvements to system performance Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application GUI improvements to the Notes application adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility and the introduction of System Integrity Protection The Metal API first introduced in iOS was also included in this operating system for all Macs since According to Apple Metal accelerates system level rendering by up to percent resulting in faster graphics performance for everyday apps Metal also delivers up to times faster draw call performance for more fluid experience in games and pro apps macOS Sierra macOS Sierra was released to the public on September New features include the addition of Siri Optimized Storage and updates to Photos Messages and iTunes macOS High Sierra macOS High Sierra was released to the public on September Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion High Sierra is a refinement based update having very few new features visible to the user including updates to Safari Photos and Mail among other changes The major change under the hood is the switch to the Apple File System optimized for the solid state storage used in most new Mac computers macOS Mojave macOS Mojave was released on September The update introduced a system wide dark mode and several new apps lifted from iOS such as Apple News It was the first version to require a GPU that supports Metal Mojave also changed the system software update mechanism from the App Store where it had been since OS X Mountain Lion to a new panel in System Preferences App updates remain in the App Store macOS Catalina macOS Catalina was released on October Updates included enhanced voice control and bundled apps for music video and podcasts that together replace the functions of iTunes and the ability to use an iPad as an external monitor Catalina officially dropped support for bit
