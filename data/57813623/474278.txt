attackers will be rewarded for completing an objective by being allowed to spawn closer to the next objective If the attacking team completes the final objective within the allowed time the teams switch roles and another round on the same map begins If not the original attackers lose If a second round begins and the new attackers complete the final objective in less time than the first attackers they win if not they lose Onslaught or ONS is a vehicle based game mode in which the objective is to capture a series of power nodes connecting the player and their opponents bases and destroy the power core located within their base First team to destroy opponents power core wins Bombing Run Each level has a ball that starts in the middle of the playing field The player s team scores by getting the ball through the enemy team s hoop The player scores points for jumping through the hoop while holding the ball and points for tossing the ball through the hoop The player holding the ball cannot use weapons but can pass the ball to teammates The ball is dropped if the player is killed Capture the Flag The player s team must score flag captures by taking the enemy flag from the enemy base and returning it to their own flag If the flag carrier is killed the flag drops to the ground for anyone to pick up If the player s team s flag is taken it must be returned by touching it after it is dropped before their team can score a flag capture Deathmatch or DM is a game type in which the point is to either reach a certain number of frags or kills or to the highest number of frags at the time limit for the match Team Deathmatch Two teams duke it out in a quest for battlefield supremacy The team with the most frags wins Invasion It is a simple survival mode The players are forced to work together to try and survive endless waves of monsters from Unreal that get increasingly difficult with each wave Once a player dies they cannot respawn until the round is over Rounds can either end after a time limit victory or when all players are dead failure Double Domination The player s team scores by capturing and holding both Control Points for ten seconds
