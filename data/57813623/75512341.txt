music festival during April and another that allowed players to purchase Fender branded instruments Development and release Fortnite Festival is developed by Harmonix the developers of the Rock Band series and the first few Guitar Hero games The game was conceived as part of Epic s goal to expand the experiences within Fortnite which included Lego Fortnite and Rocket Racing According to Harmonix CEO Alex Rigopolous their goal was to create a free to play rhythm game available to the millions of players of Fortnite with songs freely available in a manner that allowed for dynamic and quick expansion to the in game library whilst also being favorable for music publishers in order to aid this Alongside the Festival Stage and Jam Stage Harmonix also developed the Patchwork system which could be used within user made Fortnite Creative experiences or in Unreal Editor for Fortnite UEFN applications to allow creators to incorporate dynamic music systems into their creations Fortnite Festival was revealed on December during an in game Battle Royale event titled the Big Bang A part of the event featured Eminem performing Lose Yourself as an in game concert with players able to perform the notes of the song as the first reveal of Festival s gameplay The game released on December being the last game to added to Fortnite after Lego Fortnite and Rocket Racing Support for plastic guitar controllers was confirmed to already be in progress with the release of Festival Performance Designed Products PDP which previously had supplied instrument controllers for Rock Band announced a new controller for Festival in January the PDP Riffmaster This was released in April and is available in two versions one compatible for PlayStation consoles and another for Xbox consoles PC Both versions are also compatible with Rock Band featuring the same button layout and basic mechanisms With the start of Season in late April Festival was updated to support the Riffmaster and a select few other guitar controllers along with updating all past and future songs to include unique Pro Lead and Pro Bass parts that utilize the features of these controllers similar to Rock Band A May update later allowed players without guitar controllers to play these Pro tracks using standard controls The Battle Stage was added in a June update alongside Metallica content for the fourth season of Festival Reception Critics were divided on Festival s gameplay with many pointing it out as being similar to previous Harmonix games with little difference PC Gamer s Mollie Taylor believed that some song charts were repurposed from previous games Bailey Dustin of GamesRadar wrote that the game had a winning formula believing that it worked well like previous Harmonix games that built up the formula for years He stated that while he found Lego Fortnite and Rocket Racing to have more content Festival was the one that captured his heart and where he looked forward to future content the most Conversely Taylor described the game as awfully barebones compared to previous Harmonix games believing there to be a lack of polish in certain areas and found the game be unenjoyable when playing an instrument that a song didn t utilize well Nevertheless she described the game a great introduction though one that needed more work IGN s Luke Reilly echoed similar thoughts as Taylor and Dustin believing the lack of features from previous Harmonix games led to isolating gameplay that could make Fortnite players into rhythm game fans but not vice versa Responses towards in game monetization was negative Taylor believed that while it was similar to other free to play games it was a turn off from the game Reilly thought similarly finding it to be a predatory practice when compared to the average prices of music on iTunes and the cost of songs in Rock Band describing Festival s pricing as galling when compared to the latter Digital Trends Giovanni Colantonio wrote that it left him wondering if Epic Games bought Harmonix for its music game expertise or for what value it could bring to the Fortnite shop Reviewers were generally critical of the Jam Stage mode with Reilly believing it to a waste of effort entirely that was effected negatively by the price of in game content Dustin wrote that while the inclusion of a light version of Fuser stood out it typically left him wanting to quit playing after a few minutes Colantonio believed that the Jam Stage suffered the lack of interactivity compared to the main game as well as what he found to be the poor compatibility between songs He wrote that the gameplay tended to become an unmixed mess of tracks that don t fit together References
