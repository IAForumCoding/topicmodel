created by Andreas Whittam Smith Stephen Glover and Matthew Symonds All three partners were former journalists at The Daily Telegraph who had left the paper towards the end of Lord Hartwell s ownership Marcus Sieff was the first chairman of Newspaper Publishing and Whittam Smith took control of the paper The paper was created at a time of a fundamental change in British newspaper publishing Rupert Murdoch was challenging long accepted practices of the print unions and ultimately defeated them in the Wapping dispute Consequently production costs could be reduced which created openings for more competition As a result of controversy around Murdoch s move to Wapping the plant was effectively having to function under siege from sacked print workers picketing outside The Independent attracted some of the staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to his company s new headquarters Launched with the advertising slogan It is Are you and challenging both The Guardian for centre left readers and The Times as the newspaper of record The Independent reached a circulation of more than by Competing in a moribund market The Independent sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as within a few years a price war in the market sector s When The Independent launched The Independent on Sunday in sales were less than anticipated partly due to the launch of the Sunday Correspondent four months prior although this direct rival closed at the end of November Some aspects of production merged with the main paper although the Sunday paper retained a largely distinct editorial staff In the s The Independent was faced with price cutting by the Murdoch titles and started an advertising campaign accusing The Times and The Daily Telegraph of reflecting the views of their proprietors Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black It featured spoofs of the other papers mastheads with the words The Rupert Murdoch or The Conrad Black with The Independent below the main title Newspaper Publishing had financial problems A number of other media companies were interested in the paper Tony O Reilly s media group and Mirror Group Newspapers MGN had bought a stake of about a third each by mid In March Newspaper Publishing was restructured with a rights issue splitting the shareholding into O Reilly s Independent News Media MGN and Prisa publisher of El Pa s In April there was another refinancing and in March O Reilly bought the other shares of the company for million and assumed the company s debt Brendan Hopkins headed Independent News Andrew Marr was appointed editor of The Independent and Rosie Boycott became editor of The Independent on Sunday Marr introduced a dramatic if short lived redesign which won critical favour but was a commercial failure partly as a result of a limited promotional budget Marr admitted his changes had been a mistake in his book My Trade Boycott left in April to join the Daily Express and Marr left in May later becoming the BBC s political editor Simon Kelner was appointed as the editor By this time the circulation had fallen below Independent News spent heavily to increase circulation and the paper went through several redesigns While circulation increased it did not approach the level which had been achieved in or restore profitability Job cuts and financial controls reduced the morale of journalists and the quality of the product s Ivan Fallon on the board since and formerly a key figure at The Sunday Times replaced Hopkins as head of Independent News Media in July By mid the newspaper was losing million per year A gradual improvement meant that by circulation was at a nine year high In November following further staff cuts production was moved to Northcliffe House in Kensington High Street the headquarters of Associated Newspapers The two newspaper groups editorial management and commercial operations remained separate but they shared services including security information technology switchboard and payroll s On March Independent News Media sold the newspaper to a new company owned by the family of Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev for a nominal fee and million over the next months choosing this option over closing The Independent and The Independent on Sunday which would have cost million and million respectively due to long term contracts Alexander s son Evgeny became chairman of the new company with Alexander becoming a board director In Lebedev had bought a controlling stake in the London Evening Standard Two weeks later editor Roger Alton resigned In July The Independent s columnist Johann Hari was stripped of the Orwell Prize he had won in after claims to which Hari later admitted of plagiarism and inaccuracy In January Chris Blackhurst editor of The Independent told the Leveson inquiry that the scandal had severely damaged the newspaper s reputation He nevertheless told the inquiry that Hari would return as a columnist in four to five weeks Hari later announced that he would not return to The Independent Jonathan Foreman contrasted The Independent s reaction to the scandal unfavourably with the reaction of American newspapers to similar incidents such as the Jayson Blair case which led to resignations of editors deep soul searching and new standards of exactitude being imposed The historian Guy Walters suggested that Hari s fabrications had been an open secret among the newspaper s staff and that their internal inquiry was a facesaving exercise A proportion of articles are now behind a pay wall that section is titled Independent Minds The Independent and The Independent on Sunday endorsed Remain in the Brexit referendum of In March The Independent decided to close its print edition and become an online newspaper the last printed edition was published on Saturday March The Independent on Sunday published its last print edition on March and was closed following that Content Format and design The Independent began publishing as a broadsheet in a series of celebrated designs The final version was designed by Carroll Dempsey and Thirkell following a commission by Nicholas Garland who along with Alexander Chancellor was unhappy with designs produced by Raymond Hawkey and Michael McGuiness on seeing the proposed designs Chancellor had said I thought we were joining a serious paper The first edition was designed and implemented by Michael Crozier who was Executive Editor Design and Picture from pre launch in to From September the paper was produced in both broadsheet and tabloid sized versions with the same content in each The tabloid edition was termed compact to distance itself from the more sensationalist reporting style usually associated with tabloid newspapers in the UK preferring to remain focused on hard news similarly to the tabloid size edition of The Times After launching in the London area and then in North West England the smaller format appeared gradually throughout the UK Soon afterwards Rupert Murdoch s Times followed suit introducing its own tabloid sized version Prior to these changes The Independent had a daily circulation of around the lowest of any major national British daily a figure that climbed by as of March to Throughout much of circulation stagnated at a quarter of a million On May The Independent produced its last weekday broadsheet having stopped producing a Saturday broadsheet edition in January The Independent on Sunday published its last simultaneous broadsheet on October and thereafter followed a compact design until the print edition was discontinued On April The Independent redesigned its layout to a more European feel similar to France s Lib ration The redesign was carried out by a Barcelona based design studio The weekday second section was subsumed within the main paper double page feature articles became common in the main news sections and there were revisions to the front and back covers A new second section Extra was introduced on April It is similar to The Guardian s G and The Times s Times containing features reportage and games including sudoku In June The Independent on Sunday consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business and a magazine focusing on life and culture On September the main newspaper became full colour and Extra was replaced by an Independent Life Supplement focusing on different themes each day Three weeks after the acquisition of the paper by Alexander Lebedev and Evgeny Lebedev in the paper was relaunched with another redesign on April The new format featured smaller headlines and a new pullout Viewspaper section which contained the paper s comment and feature articles Front pages Following the switch in format The Independent became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages which frequently relied on images graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content For example following the Kashmir earthquake in it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund and following the publication of the Hutton Report into the death of British government scientist David Kelly its front page simply carried the word Whitewash In the paper s editor Simon Kelner was named Editor of the Year at the What the Papers Say awards partly in recognition of according to the judges his often arresting and imaginative front page designs In however as he was stepping down as editor he stated that it was possible to overdo the formula and that the style of the paper s front pages perhaps needed reinvention Under the subsequent editorship of Chris Blackhurst the campaigning poster style front pages were scaled back in favour of more conventional news stories Sections The weekday Saturday and Sunday editions of The Independent all included supplements and pull out subsections Online presence On January The Independent relaunched its online edition The relaunched site introduced a new look better access to the blog service priority on image and video content and additional areas of the site including art architecture fashion gadgets and health

has carried short video news bulletins provided by the Al Jazeera English news channel In The Independent launched a sister website i a shareable journalism site with similarities to Reddit and Upworthy Political views The Independent is generally described as centre to centre left liberal and liberal left When the paper was established in the founders intended its political stance to reflect the centre of the British political spectrum and thought that it would attract readers primarily from The Times and The Daily Telegraph It has been seen as leaning to the left wing of the political spectrum making it more a competitor to The Guardian However The Independent tends to take a liberal pro market stance on economic issues The Independent on Sunday referred to itself as a proudly liberal newspaper The paper has highlighted what it refers to as war crimes being committed by pro government forces in the Darfur region of Sudan The paper has been a strong supporter of electoral reform In The Independent on Sunday launched a campaign for the decriminalisation of cannabis Ten years later it reversed itself arguing that skunk the cannabis strain smoked by the majority of young Britons in had become times stronger than resin sold a decade ago The paper s opinion on the British monarchy has sometimes been described as republican though it officially identifies as reformist wishing for a reformed monarchy that reflects the nation over which it reigns and which is accountable to the people for its activities Originally it avoided royal stories Whittam Smith later saying he thought the British press was unduly besotted with the Royal Family and that a newspaper could manage without stories about the monarchy In Alan Rusbridger editor of The Guardian said of The Independent The emphasis on views not news means that the reporting is rather thin and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that In a June speech British Prime Minister Tony Blair called The Independent a viewspaper saying it was started as an antidote to the idea of journalism as views not news That was why it was called the Independent Today it is avowedly a viewspaper not merely a newspaper The Independent criticised Blair s comments the following day but later changed format to include a Viewspaper insert in the centre of the regular newspaper designed to feature most of the opinion columns and arts reviews A leader published on the day of the London mayoral election compared the candidates and said that if the newspaper had a vote it would vote first for the Green Party candidate Si n Berry noting the similarity between her priorities and those of The Independent and secondly with rather heavy heart for the incumbent Ken Livingstone An Ipsos MORI poll estimated that in the general election of regular readers voted Liberal Democrat voted Labour and voted Conservative compared to and respectively of the overall electorate On the eve of the general election The Independent supported the Liberal Democrats arguing that T hey are longstanding and convincing champions of civil liberties sound economics international co operation on the great global challenges and of course fundamental electoral reform These are all principles that this newspaper has long held dear However before the general election The Independent on Sunday desisted from advising its readers how to vote writing that this does not mean that we are a bloodless value free news sheet We have always been committed to social justice but the paper recognised that it was up the readers to make up their own mind about whether you agree with us or not Rather than support a particular party the paper urged all its reader to vote as a responsibility of common citizenship On May the weekday version of The Independent said that a continuation of the Conservative Liberal Democrat coalition after the general election would be a positive outcome At the end of July The Independent led a campaign they called the Final Say a change org petition by former editor Christian Broughton for a binding referendum on the Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union As of October
