Racing games are a video game genre in which the player participates in a racing competition They may be based on anything from real world racing leagues to fantastical settings They are distributed along a spectrum between more realistic racing simulations and more fantastical arcade style racing games Kart racing games emerged in the s as a popular sub genre of the latter Racing games may also fall under the category of sports video games Sub genres Arcade style racing Usually arcade style racing games put fun and a fast paced experience above all else as cars usually compete in unique ways A key feature of arcade style racers that specifically distinguishes them from simulation racers is their far more liberal physics Whereas in real racing and subsequently the simulation equivalents the driver must reduce their speed significantly to take most turns arcade style racing games generally encourage the player to powerslide the car to allow the player to keep up their speed by drifting through a turn Collisions with other racers track obstacles or traffic vehicles is usually much more exaggerated than simulation racers as well For the most part arcade style racers simply remove the precision and rigor required from the simulation experience and focus strictly on the racing element itself They often license real cars and leagues but are equally open to more exotic settings and vehicles Races take place on highways windy roads or in cities they can be multiple lap circuits or point to point sprints with one or multiple paths sometimes with checkpoints or other types of competition like demolition derby jumping or testing driving skills Popular arcade style racing franchises include Battle Gear Out Run Ridge Racer Daytona USA Need for Speed Sega Rally Cruis n Burnout Rush Midnight Club Project Gotham Racing TrackMania MotorStorm and Forza Horizon Conversely many arcade racing games in amusement arcades frequently use hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets that simulate the look and feel of driving or riding a vehicle For example a motorbike that the player sits on and moves around to control the on screen action or a car like cabinet with seats steering wheel pedals and gear stick that moves around in sync with the on screen action This has been especially common for arcade racing games from Sega since the s However this can typically only be found in arcade racing games for amusement arcades rather than arcade style racing games for home systems During the mid late s there was a trend of new street racing imitating the import scene one can tune sports compacts and sports cars and race them on the streets The most widely known ones are the Midnight Club DUB Edition and the Midnight Club series certain entries in the Need for Speed and Test Drive series Initial D series the Juiced series and FlatOut Some arcade style racing games increase the competition between racers by adding weapons that can be used against opponents to slow them down or otherwise impede their progress so they can be passed This is a staple feature in kart racing games such as the Mario Kart series but this kind of game mechanic also appears in standard car based racing games as well Weapons can range from projectile attacks to traps as well as non combative items like speed boosts Weapon based racing games include games such as Full Auto Rumble Racing Grip Combat Racing Re Volt and Blur There are also Vehicular combat games that employ racing games elements for example racing has been featured as a game mode in popular vehicular combat franchises such as Twisted Metal Destruction Derby and Carmageddon Simulation racing Simulation style racing games strive to convincingly replicate the handling of a real automobile They often license real cars or racing leagues but will sometimes use fantasy cars built to resemble real ones if unable to acquire an official license for them Vehicular behavior physics are a key factor in the experience The rigors of being a professional race driver are usually also included such as having to deal with a car s tire condition and fuel level Proper cornering technique and precision racing maneuvers such as trail braking are given priority in simulation racing games Although these racing simulators are specifically built for people with a high grade of driving skill it is not uncommon to find aids that can be enabled from the game menu The most common aids are traction control TC anti lock brakes ABS steering assistance damage resistance clutch assistance and automatic gear changes Sound plays a crucial role in player feedback in racing games with the engine and tire sounds communicating what is physically happening to the car The three main elements of car audio are intake exhaust and internal engine sounds Recorded samples of those elements are implemented in game by methods such as granular synthesis loop based modelling or physical modeling Tire sounds modulate loop samples or pitch based on slip angle and deformation to let the player know the limit of grip The best sounding games effectively integrate the sound model with the vehicle and tire simulation models Some of these racing simulators are customizable as game fans have decoded the tracks cars and executable files Internet communities have grown around the simulators regarded as the most realistic and many websites host internet championships Some of these racing simulators consist of Forza Motorsport Gran Turismo GTR Assetto Corsa iRacing Project CARS Automobilista and many more Kart racing Kart racing games have simplified driving mechanics while adding obstacles unusual track designs and various action elements Kart racers are also known to cast characters known from various platform games or cartoon television series as the drivers of wacky vehicles Kart racing games are a more arcade like experience than other racing games and usually offer modes in which player characters can shoot projectiles at one another or collect power ups Typically in such games vehicles move more alike go karts lacking anything along the lines of a gear stick and clutch pedal While car combat elements date back to earlier titles such as Taito s Crashing Race in the kart racing subgenre was popularized by Nintendo s Super Mario Kart in for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES which spawned the Mario Kart series The game was slower than other racing games of the time due to hardware limitations prompting the developers to use a go kart theme for the game Since then over kart racing games have been released featuring characters ranging from Nicktoons to South Park Futuristic racing Futuristic racing games are a type of racing game where players use science fiction vehicles such as sci fi cars or other sci fi vehicles to race against the clock or other vehicles A number of futuristic racing games may also feature vehicular combat elements In the arcades futuristic racing games date back to the s The laserdisc games Star Rider and Cosmos Circuit featured animated racing using animated laserdisc video for the backgrounds Alpha Denshi s Splendor Blast combined Pole Position style racing with Zaxxon style sci fi vehicles space settings and shoot em up elements STUN Runner by Atari Games featured D polygon graphics and allowed players to blast other vehicles On home consoles futuristic racing games were defined by Nintendo s F Zero for the SNES which spawned the F Zero series The PlayStation game Wipeout by Psygnosis featured D polygon graphics and spawned the Wipeout series The F Zero series subsequently made the transition to D polygon graphics with F Zero X for the Nintendo History Electro mechanical driving games The basis for racing video games were arcade driving electro mechanical games EM games The earliest mechanical racing arcade game dates back to when the London based Automatic Sports Company manufactured a mechanical yacht racing game Yacht Racer Mechanical car driving games later originated from British amusement arcades in the s In the United States International Mutoscope Reel Company adapted these British arcade driving games into the electro mechanical game Drive Mobile which had an upright arcade cabinet similar to what arcade video games would later use A steering wheel was used to control a model car over a road painted on a metal drum with the goal being to keep the car centered as the road shifts left and right Kasco introduced this type of driving game to Japan as Mini Drive in Capitol Projector s machine Auto Test was a driving test simulation that used film reel to project pre recorded driving video footage awarding the player points for making correct decisions as the footage is played These early EM driving games consisted of only the player vehicle on the road with no rival cars to race against EM driving games later evolved in Japan with Kasco s racing game Indy which was licensed by Chicago Coin for release in North America as Speedway in It had a circular racetrack with rival cars painted on individual rotating discs illuminated by a lamp which produced colorful graphics projected using mirrors to give a pseudo D first person perspective on a screen resembling a windscreen view The gameplay involved players driving down a circular road while dodging cars to avoid crashing and it resembled a prototypical arcade racing video game with an upright cabinet yellow marquee three digit scoring coin box steering wheel and accelerator pedal Indy sold over arcade cabinets in Japan while Speedway sold over cabinets in North America becoming one of the biggest arcade hits of the s Taito s similar rear projection driving game Super Road involved driving a car down an endlessly scrolling road while having to dodge cars which formed the basis for Taito s racing video game Speed Race One of the last successful electro mechanical arcade games was F a racing game developed and released by Namco in and distributed in North America by Atari the same year The gameplay is viewed from the perspective of the driver s viewpoint which is displayed on the screen using a projector system It was Japan s highest grossing arcade game for two years in a row in and F is believed to have been influenced by Indy and would in turn be influential on Namco s racing video games in the s Another notable EM game from the s was The Driver a racing action game released by Kasco Kansai Seiki Seisakusho Co that used mm film to project full motion video on screen though its gameplay had limited interaction requiring the player to match their steering wheel accelerator and brakes with movements shown on screen much like the sequences in later LaserDisc games Mainframe racing games The BBC television program Tomorrow s World broadcast a mainframe computer racing game played between TV presenter Raymond Baxter and British two time Formula One world champion Graham Hill on their Christmas special broadcast on Christmas Eve The game was written by IBM employee Ray Bradshaw using CALL and required two data centre operators to input the instructions Top down D racing video games Atari founder Nolan Bushnell had the idea for a driving video game in the early s When he was a college student he worked at an arcade where he became familiar with EM driving games watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery while learning how it worked and developing his understanding of how the game business operates When he founded Atari Bushnell had originally planned to develop a driving video game influenced by Speedway but they ended up developing Pong instead The earliest rudimentary racing video game to be released dates back to with the release of the first video game console the Magnavox Odyssey It included a game called Wipeout where the player moves a dot around a race track that is outlined by an overlay placed on the television screen It required the use of physical items to play including a race game board screen overlay car tokens and pit stop cards In Atari released Space Race an arcade video game where players control spaceships that race against opposing ships while avoiding comets and meteors It is a competitive two player game with black and white graphics and controlled with a two way joystick The following year Atari released the first driving video game in the arcades Gran Trak which presents an overhead single screen view of the track in low resolution white on black graphics It inspired the Kee Games clone Formula K which sold arcade cabinets In late Taito released Speed Race designed by Tomohiro Nishikado of Space Invaders fame in which the player drives down a straight track dodging other cars The game used vertical scrolling inspired by two older electro mechanical games Kasco s Mini Drive and Taito s Super Road Speed Race was re branded as Wheels by Midway Games for release in North America and was influential on later racing games Midway also released another version Racer with a sit down cabinet Speed Race became a hit in Japan while Wheels and Wheels II sold cabinets in the United States Its use of vertical scrolling was adopted by Atari s Hi way which introduced a sit down cabinet similar to older electro mechanical games In Atari released Super Bug a racing game historically significant as the first game to feature a scrolling playfield in multiple directions Sega s Monaco GP was one of the most successful traditional D racing games becoming the most popular arcade driving game in the US in and among the highest grossing games that year while making a record number of appearances on the RePlay arcade charts through In Namco s overhead view driving game Rally X was one of the first games to have background music and allowed scrolling in multiple directions both vertical and horizontal It also uses a radar to show the rally car s location on the map Pseudo D racing video games In February Sega released the arcade game Road Race which was re worked into a motorbike variant Moto Cross also known as Man T T released August It was then re branded as Fonz in the US as a tie in for the popular sitcom Happy Days The game featured a three dimensional perspective view as well as haptic feedback which caused the motorcycle handlebars to vibrate during a collision with another vehicle In Spring the arcade game N rburgring presented a first person view Considered the first scandalous arcade game Exidy s Death Race was widely criticized in the media for its violent content which only served to substantially increase its popularity Sega released a two player version of Man T T called Twin Course T T in January saw the release of Vectorbeam s Speed Freak a three dimensional vector racing game which Killer List of Videogames calls very impressive and ahead of their time Turbo released by Sega in was the first racing game to use sprite scaling with full color graphics Pole Position developed by Namco and released by Atari in North America was released in It is considered arguably the most important racing game ever made It was an evolution of Namco s earlier racing electro mechanical games notably F whose designer Sho Osugi worked on Pole Position Pole Position was the first video game to be based on a real racing circuit and the first with a qualifying lap where the player needs to complete a time trial before they can compete in Grand Prix races While not the first third person racing video game it was predated by Sega s Turbo Pole Position established the conventions of the genre and its success inspired numerous imitators According to Electronic Games for the first time in the amusement parlors a first person racing game gives a higher reward for passing cars and finishing among the leaders rather than just for keeping all four wheels on the road According to IGN it also introduced checkpoints and its success as the highest grossing arcade game of in North America cemented the genre in place for decades to come and inspired a horde of other racing games It sold over arcade cabinets in the US by and again became the highest grossing arcade game of in the US Taito s Laser Grand Prix introduced in July was the first racing laserdisc game using pre recorded live action footage In several other racing laserdisc games followed including Sega s GP World with live action footage and Universal s Top Gear featuring D animated race car driving The same year Irem s The Battle Road was a vehicle combat racing game with branching paths and up to possible routes Geoff Crammond who later developed the Grandprix series Known collectively as GPX to its fanbase produced what is considered the first attempt at a racing simulator on a home system REVS released for the BBC Microcomputer The game offered an unofficial and hence with no official team or driver names associated with the series recreation of British Formula The hardware capabilities limited the depth of the simulation and restricted it initially to one track but it offered a semi realistic driving experience with more detail than most other racing games at the time Since the mid s it became a trend for arcade racing games to use hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets The trend was sparked by Sega s taikan games with taikan meaning body sensation in Japanese The taikan trend began when Yu Suzuki s team at Sega later known as Sega AM developed Hang On a racing video game where the player sits on and moves a motorbike replica to control the in game actions Hang On was a Grand Prix style motorbike racer It used force feedback technology and was also one of the first arcade games to use bit graphics and Sega s Super Scaler technology that allowed pseudo D sprite scaling at high frame rates Hang On became the highest grossing arcade game of in the United States and one of the year s highest grossing arcade games in Japan and London Suzuki s team at Sega followed it with hydraulic motion simulator cockpit cabinets for later racing games notably Out Run It was one of the most graphically impressive games of its time known for its pseudo D sprite based driving engine and it became an instant classic that spawned many sequels It was also notable for giving the player the non linear choice of which route to take through the game and the choice of soundtrack to listen to while driving represented as radio stations The game has up to five endings depending on the route taken and each one was an ending sequence rather than a simple Congratulations as was common in game endings at the time It became Sega s best selling arcade cabinet of the s with over arcade cabinets sold worldwide The same year Durell released Turbo Esprit which had an official Lotus license and working car indicator lights In Square released Rad Racer one of the first stereoscopic D games In the same year Atari produced RoadBlasters a driving game that also involved a bit of shooting One of the last successful pseudo D arcade racers was Sega s Super Monaco GP a simulation of the Monaco Grand Prix It was the third highest grossing arcade game of in Japan and again the third highest grossing arcade game of in Japan In Nintendo released Super Mario Kart but it was known that it was pseudo D racing Here it has items to affect players from racing and the referee Lakitu will help you out to know the rules and rescue racers from falling down Transition to D polygon graphics In Namco released Winning Run which used D polygon graphics It became the second highest grossing arcade game of in Japan In Atari released Hard Drivin another arcade driving game that used D polygon graphics It uses force feedback where the wheel fights the player during aggressive turns and a crash replay camera view Sega produced Virtua Racing in While not the first arcade racing game with D graphics it was predated by Winning Run Hard Drivin and Stunts it was able to combine the best features of games at the time along with multiplayer machine linking and clean D graphics to produce a game that was above and beyond the arcade market standard of its time laying the foundations for subsequent D racing games It improved on earlier D racing games with more complex D models and backdrops higher frame rate and switchable camera angles including chase cam and first person views IGN considers it the third most influential racing game of all time In Namco released Ridge Racer Its D polygon graphics stood out for the use of Gouraud shading and texture mapping And thus began the polygon war of driving games Sega later released Daytona USA which featured D polygon graphics with texture filtering The following year Electronic Arts produced The Need for Speed which would later spawn one of the world s most successful racing game series and one of the most successful video game series In the same year Midway introduced Crusin USA Emergence of sim racing subgenre The now defunct Papyrus Design Group produced their first attempt at a racing simulator in the critically acclaimed Indianapolis The Simulation designed by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari The game is generally regarded as the first true auto racing simulation on a personal computer Accurately replicating the Indianapolis grid it offered advanced D graphics for its time setup options car failures and handling Unlike most other racing games at the time Indianapolis attempted to simulate realistic physics and telemetry such as its portrayal of the relationship between the four contact patches and the pavement as well as the loss of grip when making a high speed turn forcing the player to adopt a proper racing line and believable throttle to brake interaction It includes a garage facility to allow players to enact modifications to their vehicle including adjustments to the tires shocks and wings The damage modelling while not accurate by today s standards was capable of producing some spectacular and entertaining pile ups Crammond s Formula One Grand Prix in became the new champion of sim racing until the release of Papyrus IndyCar Racing the following year Formula One Grand Prix boasted detail that was unparalleled for a computer game at the time as well as a full recreation of the drivers cars and circuits of the Formula One World Championship However the U S version known as World Circuit was not granted an official license by the FIA so teams and drivers were renamed though all could be changed back to their real names using the Driver Team selection menu Ayrton Senna became Carlos Sanchez for example In Sega Rally Championship introduced rally racing and featured cooperative gameplay alongside the usual competitive multiplayer Sega Rally was also the first to feature driving on different surfaces including asphalt gravel and mud with different friction properties and the car s handling changing accordingly making it an important milestone in the genre present Modern racing games During the early to mid s Sega and Namco largely had a monopoly on high end arcade racing games with realistic D visuals In a number of competitors attempted to challenge their dominance in the field including Atari Games with San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing Gaelco with Speed Up Jaleco with Super GT h and Konami with Winding Heat In Nintendo created a D game called Mario Kart a sequel to Super Mario Kart and has an action so that Lakitu needs to either reverse rev up your engines to Rocket Start or rescue players Mario Kart focused more on the items used Atari didn t join the D craze until when it introduced San Francisco Rush In Gran Turismo was released for the PlayStation after being in production for five years since It was considered the most realistic racing simulation game in its time combined with playability enabling players of all skill levels to play It offered a wealth of meticulous tuning options and introduced an open ended career mode where players had to undertake driving tests to acquire driving licenses earn their way into races and choose their own career path The Gran Turismo series has since become the second most successful racing game franchise of all time selling over million units worldwide as of April By the typical PC was capable of matching an arcade machine in terms of graphical quality mainly due to the introduction of first generation D accelerators such as DFX Voodoo The faster CPUs were capable of simulating increasingly realistic physics car control and graphics Colin McRae Rally was introduced in to the PC world and was a successful semi simulation of the world of rally driving previously only available in the less serious Sega Rally Championship Motorhead a PC game was later adapted back to arcade In the same year Sega releases Daytona USA Battle On The Edge and Power Edition which is one of the first racing games to feature realistic crashes and graphics The year introduced Crash Team Racing a kart racing game featuring the characters from Crash Bandicoot It was praised for its controls and courses Crash Bandicoot and its racing series has continued with the most recent game being Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled June The year also marked a change of games into more free form worlds Midtown Madness for the PC allows the player to explore a simplified version of the city of Chicago using a variety of vehicles and any path that they desire In the arcade world Sega introduced Crazy Taxi a sandbox racing game where you are a taxi driver that needed to get the client to the destination in the shortest amount of time A similar game also from Sega is Emergency Call Ambulance with almost the same gameplay pick up patient drop off at hospital as fast as possible Games are becoming more and more realistic visually Some arcade games are now featuring screens to provide a surround view In Angel Studios now Rockstar San Diego introduced the first free roaming or the former free form racing game on video game consoles and handheld game consoles with Midnight Club Street Racing which released on the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance The game allowed the player to drive anywhere around virtual recreations of London and New York Instead of using enclosed tracks for races the game uses various checkpoints on the free roam map as the pathway of the race giving the player the option to take various shortcuts or any other route to the checkpoints of the race In Namco released Wangan Midnight to the arcade and later released an upgrade called Wangan Midnight R Wangan Midnight R was also ported to the PlayStation by Genki as just Wangan Midnight In Rockstar San Diego s Midnight Club II was the first racing game to feature both playable cars and playable motorcycles Namco released a sort of sequel to Wangan Midnight R called Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune There is a wide gamut of driving games ranging from simple action arcade racers like Mario Kart Deluxe for Nintendo Switch and Nicktoon Racers to ultra realistic simulators like Grand Prix Legends iRacing Virtual Grand Prix Live for Speed NetKar Pro GT Legends GTR rFactor X Motor Racing CarX Street and iPad D racer Exhilarace See also Formula One video games List of racing video games Vehicle simulation game List of vehicular
