Tower defense TD is a subgenre of strategy games where the goal is to defend a player s territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers or by stopping enemies from reaching the exits usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack This typically means building a variety of different structures that serve to automatically block impede attack or destroy enemies Tower defense is seen as a subgenre of real time strategy video games due to its real time origins even though many modern tower defense games include aspects of turn based strategy Strategic choice and positioning of defensive elements is an essential strategy of the genre History Precursors The tower defense game Tower Defense Simulator can trace its lineage back to the golden age of arcade video games in the s The object of the arcade game Space Invaders released in was to defend the player s territory represented by the bottom of the screen against waves of incoming enemies The game featured shields that could be used to strategically obstruct enemy attacks on the player and assist the player in defending their territory though not to expressly protect the territory The game Missile Command changed that by giving shields a more strategic role In the game players could obstruct incoming missiles and there were multiple attack paths in each attack wave Missile Command was also the first of its kind to make use of a pointing device a trackball enabling players to use a crosshair The innovation was ahead of its time and anticipated the genre s later boom which was paved by the wide adoption of the computer mouse Additionally in Missile Command the sole target of the attackers is the base not a specific player character For these reasons some regard it as the first true game in the genre While later arcade games like Defender and Choplifter lacked the strategy element of Missile Command they began a trend of games that shifted the primary objective to defending non player items In these games defending non players from waves of attackers is key to progressing Parker Brothers title Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back for the Atari was one of the first tie ins to popularize the base defense style The concept of waves of enemies attacking the base in single file in this case AT ATs proved a formula that was subsequently copied by many games as the shift from arcade to PC gaming began Players were now able to choose from different methods of obstructing attackers progress Sorcerer s Apprentice for the Atari featured Mickey Mouse and was first published in Nintendo s popular s Game Watch handheld games featured many popular precursors With their fixed sprite cells with binary states games with waves of attackers following fixed paths were able to make use of the technical limitations of the platform yet proved simple and enjoyable to casual gamers Vermin one of the first tasked players with defending the garden a theme followed by many later games from relentless horde of moles The following years saw a flood of similar titles including Manhole Parachute and Popeye saw multiple titles with the primary object of protecting buildings from burning Fire Attack Oil Panic and Mickey Donald The later titles utilized multiple articulating screens to increase the difficulty for players With two screens these games introduced basic resource management e g oil and water forcing players to multitask Green House was another popular two screen game in which players use clouds of pesticide spray to protect flowers from waves of attacking insects Despite the early rush of archetypal titles ultimately there was a general decline in fixed cell games due to their technical limitations simplistic gameplay and the rise of personal computers and handhelds the Game Boy correspondingly this genre also declined A rare exception was Safebuster multi screen in which the player protects a safe from a thief trying to blow it up By the mid s the strategy elements began to further evolve Early PC gaming examples include the Commodore titles Gandalf the Sorcerer a shooter with tower defense elements and Imagine Software s release Pedro Pedro a garden defense game introduced new gameplay elements including different enemy types as well as the ability to place fixed obstructions and to build and repair the player s territory Modern genre emerges Rampart released in is generally considered to have established the prototypical tower defense Rampart introduced player placed defenses that automatically

era Tower defense gameplay also made an appearance on consoles with several minigames in the Final Fantasy series including a tower defense minigame in Final Fantasy VI and the Fort Condor minigame in

Heart a gigantic gem at the centre of your dungeon which if destroyed would cause the player to lose the game Fortress was released for the Game Boy Advance in As real time strategy games gained popularity in PC gaming many introduced tower defense modes in their gameplay particularly in multiplayer In February the custom maps for Warcraft III Element TD and Gem Tower Defense which were initially created in Warcraft III World Editor almost single handedly rekindled the genre These titles would also bring role playing elements to the genre for the first time boom Between and the genre

large number of other tower defense games many spinoffs of Tower Defense Simulator and a few original titles such as Tower Blitz Tower Heroes Ready Defend Evolution Evade and many more Gameplay The basic gameplay elements of tower defense are territories possessions domiciles collectively the base that must be defended by the player or players waves of multiple incoming enemies that must be defended against placement of tower elements such as towers or obstructions along the path of attacking enemies What distinguishes tower defense base defending games from other base defending games such as Space Invaders or other games where bases are defended is the player s ability to strategically place construct or summon obstructive constructions and constructive obstructions in the path of attacking enemies In a tower defense the player s main character is often invincible as their primary objective is the survival of the base rather than the player Some features of modern tower defense Player placed obstructions that can damage or kill enemy attackers before they destroy the base Ability to repair obstructions Ability to upgrade obstructions Ability to repair upgrades to obstructions Some sort of currency with which to purchase upgrades and repairs this can be time in game currency or experience points such as being earned by the defeat of an attacking unit Enemies capable of traversing multiple paths at once Each wave usually has a set number and types of enemies Unlock new maps and levels Tower that have the ability to move Many modern tower defense games evolved from real time to turn based cycling through distinct gameplay phases such as build defend repair and celebrate Many games such as Flash Element Tower Defense feature enemies that scamper through a maze which allows the player to strategically place towers for optimal effectiveness However some versions of the genre force the user to create the maze out of their own towers such as Desktop Tower Defense Some versions of the genre are a hybrid of these two types with preset paths that can be modified to some extent by tower placement or towers that can be modified by path placement or modifications that can be placed by tower paths Often an essential strategy is mazing the tactic of creating a long winding path of towers or maze to lengthen the distance the enemies must traverse to get past the defense Sometimes juggling is possible by alternating between barricading an exit on one side and then the other side to cause the enemies to path back and forth until they are defeated Some games also allow players to modify the attack strategy used by towers to be able to defend for an even more tantalizingly reasonable price The degree of the player s control or lack thereof in such games also varies from games where the player controls a unit within the game world to games where the player has no direct control over units at all or even no control over the game whatsoever A common theme in tower defense games to have occasional air units which ignore the layout of the board i e maze paths or obstructions and travel directly to the end destination or enemies which prioritize different targets than their main destination Some tower defense games or custom maps also require the player to not only defend their own board but send out enemies to attack their opponents game boards or opponent controlled areas of a common game board in return Such games are also known as tower wars game boards USPTO trademark On June COM US Corporation was awarded the
