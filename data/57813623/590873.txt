Timothy Dean Sweeney born is an American video game programmer and businessman He is the founder and CEO of Epic Games and the creator of Unreal Engine a game development platform Early life Sweeney was raised in Potomac Maryland the youngest of three brothers At a young age he became interested in tinkering with mechanical and electrical devices and stated he had taken apart a lawnmower as early as five or six and later built his own go kart He became interested in arcade games when they began to become popular in the late s knowing that like the mechanics devices he took apart and repaired there were those that had programmed the games in the machines Though the family got an Atari Sweeney was not as interested in the games for that outside of Adventure and later said he had not played many video games in his life and very few to completion At the age of Sweeney visited his older brother s new startup in California where he had access to early IBM Personal Computers Sweeney spent the week there learning BASIC and establishing his interest in programming while he had had a Commodore before Sweeney was much more taken by how easy the IBM PC was to use When his family got an Apple II Sweeney began in earnest learning how to program on that trying to make Adventure in the spirit of the Atari game Sweeney estimated that between the ages of and he spent over hours teaching himself how to program using information on online bulletin boards and completed several games though never shared these with others He also learned from his brothers concepts of entrepreneurship As a teenager he made a good deal of money by offering to mow lawns of wealthy residents in the area for half the price of professional services Founding of Epic Games Sweeney attended the University of Maryland starting around where he studied mechanical engineering though he was still fascinated by computers Around this time his father who worked for the Defense Mapping Agency gave him an IBM Personal Computer AT Sweeney established a consulting business Potomac Computer Systems out of his parents home but it never took off and he shelved the company Later Sweeney had the idea of creating games that could be sold programming them at night or over weekends outside college work This first required him to create a text editor based on the Pascal language to be able to program the game which led to the idea of making a game out of the text editor itself This became the basis of ZZT He let college friends and those around his neighborhood provide feedback and was aware it was something he could sell to other computer users To distribute the game Sweeney looked to the shareware model and wrote to Scott Miller of Apogee Software Ltd a leading shareware producer at the time for ideas on how to distribute ZZT He revitalized Potomac Computer Systems for selling ZZT fulfilling mail orders with help of his father ZZT sold well enough a few copies each day that came to about US per day that Sweeney decided to make developing games his career Recognizing he needed a better name for a video game company he renamed Potomac Computer Systems to Epic MegaGames Following ZZT Sweeney started working on his next title Jill of the Jungle but found that he lacked the skills to complete this alone He formed a team of four people to complete the game by mid For continued development Sweeney sought out a business partner for Epic MegaGames eventually coming to Mark Rein who had just been let go from id Software Rein helped with growing and managing the company due to the company s growth Sweeney did not end up getting his degree short by one credit Sweeney would later start work on the Unreal Engine developed for the first person shooter Unreal and licensed by multiple other video games With the success of Unreal the company relocated to North Carolina in and changed its name to Epic Games Conservation and philanthropy Since the real estate bubble collapsed

acres of forest land including the Box Creek Wilderness a acre natural area that contains more than rare and threatened plants and wildlife species Sweeney who had paid million for Box Creek Wilderness donated the conservation easement to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in One of the motives to put Box Creek Wilderness under conservation easement was a condemnation lawsuit filed by a power company who planned to build a transmission line through the land The lawsuit was settled following the Fish and Wildlife Service s and Senator Richard Burr s involvement in
