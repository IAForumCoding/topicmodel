ZZT is a action adventure puzzle video game and game creation system developed and published by Potomac Computer Systems for MS DOS It was later released as freeware in It is an early game allowing user generated content using object oriented programming Players control a smiley face to battle various creatures and solve puzzles in different grid based boards in a chosen world It has four worlds where players explore different boards and interact with objects such as ammo bombs and scrolls to reach the end of the game It includes an in game editor allowing players to develop worlds using the game s scripting language ZZT OOP The game was designed by mechanical engineering student Tim Sweeney in roughly six to nine months It was built from a text editor conceived in to build a better editor for Pascal after he disliked editors that came with other programming languages During development he experimented with adding creatures and characters He built boards that grew into worlds and refined the editor he used to create his own games while studying at university Initially he made the game for himself but after positive reception from his friends and neighbors and seeing the potential for making a profit by releasing the game under shareware he released it publicly He marketed the game by distributing it across shareware vendors and bulletin board systems earning money through mail orders for registered worlds ZZT was a commercial success with around copies by The game received mixed reception Much of the positive reception focused on the gameplay editor and the community it developed Criticisms focused on the game s graphical and audio limitations and perceived unfair difficulty The sequel is Super ZZT Other ZZT worlds were published later as Best of ZZT and ZZT s Revenge ZZT s success led Sweeney to change his company s name to Epic MegaGames and focus on competing as a video game company using shareware to distribute commercial games Epic MegaGames later developed other successful games including Jill of the Jungle and Unreal using lessons from ZZT s success by focusing on developing the editor and engine to allow others to more easily make games The game inspired one of the earliest active modding communities which has grown by making new worlds editing tools and source ports and inspiring some in the community to pursue a career in the video game industry Gameplay ZZT is a top down action adventure puzzle video game and game creation system Players control a white smiley face on a navy blue rectangle that can move around in four directions Players can interact with objects by touching or shooting at them Touching ammo containers gems torches and keys adds them to your status bar Boxes of ammo allow players to fire bullets at objects gems increase health and are used as currency torches light up a small area around the player in dark boards and colored keys allow players to open same colored doors Other objects in the game include bombs doors and scrolls One type of object called Object interacts based on written scripts using the game s scripting language ZZT OOP As an example the object could be programmed to give the player health or fire bullets at the player flashing text in response At any time players can save their progress and return to the game s exact state Game worlds are made up of objects within grid boards that connect to each other Players can move across different boards by either reaching the edge of the board or entering teleporters Six game worlds were made for the game s release four of them are game worlds and each of the four starts in a different area Town of ZZT starts in a hub world with four buildings mixed with six exits Caves of ZZT opens with a sparse area of torches and a scroll Dungeons of ZZT starts with a linear opening sequence with gates that lock the player inside and City of ZZT opens with a city street as a hub with a few structures Two other worlds were included serving different purposes Guided Tour ZZT s Other Worlds previews boards of each game worlds and Demo of the ZZT World Editor creates parallels to a museum by showing all of the items terrains and creatures that make up ZZT The goal for players are to reach the end board progressing either by collecting purple keys to open locked doors or gathering objects throughout the world Boards can contain action or puzzles Action boards have the player face off against creatures Creatures include lions tigers and bears When creatures bullets or stars touch the player health is lost Once the player runs out of health the game ends Puzzles consist of untangling combinations of boulders sliders and pushers or mazes that can include invisible walls and teleporters Some puzzles can trap the player leading players to require returning to an earlier save ZZT includes an in game editor allowing players to make their own worlds Players start with yellow normal walls surrounding a new board as a blank screen The editor allows players to add and arrange items creatures and terrain and connect different boards together Each board can be set to include specific settings such as adding a time limit making the board dark so the player could not see the board without a torch or limiting the number of bullets on screen at any given time Each board had its own isolated variables within the game and through scripting players could create ten different boolean flags for the environment shared across boards Using ZZT OOP objects can be named given commands for actions and can send and receive messages Everything within ZZT is displayed in the characters of the IBM PC s character set to create environments The game supports sixteen colors but the editor only permits seven colors for colorable objects and has limits in the amount of objects being placed in each board Players eventually learned additional ways to add more colors to the game utilizing commands and different text characters and editing world files The PC speaker permits seven notes at several different octaves and instruments with unique pitches of clicks pops and snaps to represent percussion Sounds are played through normal gameplay or making custom sounds through scripting Development Video game programmer Tim Sweeney studying mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland first developed ZZT as a text editor in Turbo Pascal During this time Tim did not know how to program graphics and only had a computer and a Model M keyboard The text editor idea came from disliking the included editors for the programming languages he tried on his PC Instead he wanted to recreate his previously made Pascal like programming environment for the Apple II He experimented with adding collision to text characters and made the cursor a controllable character He found it more fun to make it into a game by adding bullets and creatures to fight From there he designed his first levels from text files creating different boards similar in style to Atari s Adventure while continually offering additions to the game and editor Sweeney studied during the day and worked on his game during the night The text based graphics allowed him to produce ideas such as talking trees or interesting characters without breaking immersion Most of these additions were his own but he occasionally took ideas from Kroz such as the bomb Development took around six to nine months with under hours of time spent developing the game and making around lines of Pascal code He shared it with friends and neighborhood kids taking notes of their joy and excitement playing his own game He discovered that making games allowed him to share something to the world and could earn more income compared to wage earners and chose to sell the game The game s episodic model took inspiration from Apogee s shareware model and he encouraged spreading the game across shareware vendors user groups and bulletin board systems He operated his company out of his bedroom having orders sent to his parents address where he would send the remaining episodes on floppy disks by mail delivery During development he wrote to Scott Miller for advice and to learn more about the industry Miller responded with advice and encouragement Sweeney chose the name so it would be listed last alphabetically in shareware catalogs and on bulletin board systems though a fan later suggested the backronym of Zoo of Zero Tolerance which Sweeney endorsed He sold it as the first major game with object oriented programming ZZT was released on January Town of ZZT alongside the in game editor was distributed freely while the other official worlds could be ordered to receive a single floppy disk including the purchased worlds and drawn maps of each of the worlds At one point City of ZZT was also distributed as ZZT s City through Softdisk s On Disk Monthly service Each of the remaining official worlds along with other ZZT games were later released as freeware on October Reception Following ZZT s release about three to four copies were sold daily at around copies by November and around to copies in total by Sweeney earned around US equivalent to in per day by November and around equivalent to in from ZZT by May of which most of the profit came from its first year After Sweeney moved out of his parents house to establish proper corporate headquarters for Potomac Computer Systems then renamed Epic MegaGames his father Paul Sweeney continued fulfilling mail orders to the original address under the Epic Classics label allowing for purchase of physical copies of ZZT The final copy of ZZT was shipped to game designer Zack Hiwiller in November Contemporary and retrospective reviews from critics were mixed A comment from Computer Gaming World billed ZZT as truly charming finding the gameplay simple to learn Scott Wolf of PC Gamer US stated the graphics and sound for ZZT to be truly awful while the gameplay serves as a flashback to when gameplay was not overshadowed by flashy video and animation Benj Edwards has called ZZT an influential and underrated game crediting its current enjoyment from playing community made worlds and making unexpected things with the fairly robust built in editor This is while crediting the official worlds for being a depthy adventure game full of puzzles challenge and humor Chris Kohler of Wired called it a simple fun and not always intuitive game design tool under the fa ade of a simple adventure game blending seamless game design and play that makes it attractive and user friendly He found making a game fun due to the interface being nearly identical to the game allowing for the easy placement of objects and terrain Rock Paper Shotgun s Ollie Toms focused on the editor finding the game to be a colourful characterful years long course in scripting and programming games He wrote that though ZZT OOP was basic and limited children could learn about and make games without knowing anything about programming Hardcore Gaming in a podcast episode stated ZZT was not all that fun criticizing that official worlds and community made worlds included unavoidable damage and instant death They found that games that attempted to expand and push the engine further are generally rough around the edges or more functional rather than good Rather they admired ZZT like a science experiment or a demo from a demoscene existing to study and push the limits of ZZT finding the game itself and the community that built from it technically impressive Legacy By getting per day from ZZT Sweeney was convinced he could earn enough from the shareware industry and decided to work in the video game industry He renamed the company to Epic MegaGames in October Shortly after the release of ZZT Sweeney started a level designer contest for registered users to make their own worlds and submit them to him Over users submitted their custom worlds The best collaboration games that won the contest were included in The Best of ZZT and ZZT s Revenge released in The winners of the contest received prizes of gift certificates while others would receive honorable mentions The six winning custom worlds that made up ZZT s Revenge earned the designers employment in Epic MegaGames with the winning worlds being Ezanya Fantasy Crypt Smiley Guy Manor and Darbytown Sweeney later asked one of these developers Allen Pilgrim to create the shareware world Monster Zoo for the sequel to ZZT Super ZZT released on October Other worlds available for purchase were Proving Grounds and Lost Forest The game plays similarly to ZZT while adding more features such as greater colors accessible within its editor new enemies and objects and scrolling map screens that allowed for larger boards than in ZZT Although Super ZZT incorporated several additions to ZZT it never caught on with the ZZT community like the original ZZT did and very few games were ever created for Super ZZT with one reason being due to the editor being hidden during normal play After publishing Best of ZZT and ZZT s Revenge Sweeney realized the community began creating worlds that reached or exceeded the quality of his work Furthermore he believed that games with cutting edge graphics and sound similar in commercial quality to Super Nintendo Entertainment System or Sega Genesis games would have higher sales in the shareware model taking influence from Commander Keen and Duke Nukem As such he moved away from ZZT indefinitely to work on other projects like Jill of the Jungle He has commented on wanting to build a massive multiplayer online version of ZZT during an interview but his future focus on the company was to move forward with new franchises while learning from the success of ZZT Sweeney and Mark Rein later credited that much of the core idea of Unreal and Unreal Engine came from what Sweeney learned from the success of ZZT with a focus on building games with clean code and editing tools so that others can build their own games Mark Rein has claimed that Unreal Tournament became a spiritual successor to the game thanks to the game s modding community and versatile developer tools An early modding community emerged within Prodigy America Online Compuserve and the Internet Many fan made worlds and editing tools are curated on a fan website Museum of ZZT The game provided the community with an outlet for creativity and self expression without artistic or programming skills especially among stigmatized groups such as transgender people As of more than worlds have been created using the built in editor or third party editors such as KevEdit Tim Sweeney has claimed that tens of thousands of workers in the game industry have previously made worlds in ZZT A port called Zeta allows for playing ZZT games on Windows or a web browser and another source port DreamZZT allows ports to consoles specifically the Dreamcast and Nintendo DS Worlds continue to be developed that have expanded beyond its intended genre creating shoot em ups falling block puzzle games complex role playing games and point and click adventure games sometimes deriving from other entertainment releases The source code of ZZT was lost in a computer crash a community developer Adrian Siekierka reconstructed and released the source code in creating a binary accurate executable of ZZT with Sweeney s permission On January the original source code for ZZT without third party content was uploaded to GitHub under the MIT License with permission of Tim Sweeney Other games have been inspired by ZZT such as MegaZeux PuzzleScript and Frog Fractions and authors of ZZT worlds became professional video game developers Rock Paper Shotgun has made comparisons to Minecraft and Roblox in its ability to serve as a start for new video game developers Wired and Hardcore Gaming found similarities in its seamless blend of gameplay and editing to LittleBigPlanet References Further reading
