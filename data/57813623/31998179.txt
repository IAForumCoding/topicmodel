Controversy PC build guide In September The Verge published the article How to Build a Custom PC for Editing Gaming or Coding with a companion YouTube video entitled How we Built a Custom Gaming PC The video was criticized for containing errors on almost every step presented by its host Stefan Etienne such as applying a liberal amount of thermal paste onto the processor as opposed to a small amount An online harassment campaign against Etienne ensued In February lawyers from The Verge s parent company Vox Media filed a DMCA takedown notice requesting that YouTube remove videos critical of The Verge s video alleging copyright infringement YouTube took down two of the videos uploaded by YouTube channels BitWit and ReviewTechUSA while applying a copyright strike to these two channels YouTube later reinstated the two videos and retracted the copyright strikes after a request from Verge editor Nilay Patel although Patel acknowledged that he agreed with the legal argument that led to their removal Timothy B Lee of Ars Technica described this controversy as an example of the Streisand effect saying that while law regarding fair use is unclear regarding this type of situation the one legal precedent suggests that this kind of video is solidly within the bounds of copyright s fair use doctrine Nearly three years after the erroneous build PC builder and YouTuber Linus Sebastian collaborated with Etienne in a video entitled Fixing the Verge PC build to rectify the mistakes thereof In it Etienne admitted not being an experienced builder at the time having built only four computers at that point with The Verge build being his first on camera and revealed that before the video went live The Verge was unwilling to hear from him to address what he saw were editing issues insisting that the video be uploaded regardless See also Journalism portal New York City portal Technology portal References External links Official website
