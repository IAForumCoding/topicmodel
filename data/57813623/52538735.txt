The SXSW Gaming Awards were awards given to video games during the annual South by Southwest Festival SXSW held in Austin Texas typically in March of that year The Awards were part of the SXSW Gaming Expo which is part of the SXSW Interactive branch of the festival History Video games had been part of the SXSW within the SXSW Interactive branch in the festival launched Screenburn as a special portion of the Interactive branch for video games and later renamed this to SXSW Gaming in Matthew Crump a veteran game developer joined SXSW in and spearheaded the efforts to create the SXSW Gaming Awards to premiere during the festival The new awards in fifteen different categories were announced in September to be awarded during the festival However Crump died from a heart attack just before the festival The event organizers opted to rename the Cultural Innovation in Gaming to the Matthew Crump Cultural Innovation Award to honor Crump s contributions to the festival The Gaming Awards were discontinued by SXSW in due to a desire to streamline our festival a bit more Format Developers and publishers must submit their games for consideration to the festival organizers prior to a deadline these games generally must have had public release in the preceding calendar year to the festival for example for the inaugural awards games had to be released in The festival s organizers along with a panel of industry experts review all submissions and select the top five for each of the game categories These are then opened to public voting for the final winner for each award to be chosen The Gamer s Voice awards are exceptional to these they are limited only to indie games released in the previous calendar year or the current year and which any member of the public may nominate The festival organizers select multiple games typically more than five after playing through each as nominees for the award These games are featured in playable form at the SXSW festival to allow attendees to try them before they vote for their favorite The awards ceremony is held near the end of the SXSW event with celebrity and gaming hosts presenting the awards The SXSW event was cancelled
