deal with in order to complete the level Episodes are tied by a single storyline usually progressing after each episode is finished Gameplay mechanics in Jazz are very similar to Zool s with the exception of not being able to destroy the enemies by simply jumping at them which was not added until the second game Jazz will run faster and jump higher the longer he runs avoiding chasms that might lead to harmful objects Unlike other platform games however there are no abysses and every level bifurcates into subsections that might lead to valuable items such as weapon pick ups score items etc while the direction of general progression is hinted at with occasional arrows Jazz has a life bar that changes in colour based on how much health Jazz has remaining Jazz can withstand a limited number of hits on Easy mode on Medium mode on Hard or Turbo mode from harmful objects before losing a life one hit s worth of health can be restored by picking up a carrot Lives can also be accumulated to the maximum number of ten When killed Jazz starts from the level beginning or at any checkpoint sign that had been reached and shot before Items that the player can pick up usually resemble food computer hardware components or other familiar shapes and give score points each There are also several beneficial pick ups in the game a force shield that protects Jazz from one or four hits a Hip Hop that shoots enemies a hoverboard that allows flight rapid fire super jump bonuses a temporary speed up and invincibility as well as extra lives Weapons also vary in numbers and consistency and include besides the Blaster Bouncer Toaster RF Missile and TNT sets Large sets of ammunition can only be collected by being shot from their enclosure The first game has a timer that starts a number of minutes at the beginning of each level minutes and seconds on Easy mode minutes on Medium minutes on Hard and minutes on Turbo and counts down to zero on Hard and Turbo another countdown appears at the top of the screen when there is less than a minute left and if time expires Jazz loses a life If Jazz reaches and shoots the finish sign before time runs out the player is then provided with additional score points awarded for the remaining time and a perfect score if he picks up all items and or deals with all enemies If Jazz finishes the area with a big red diamond he gets to enter the bonus stage In these stages animation switches to a pseudo D third person shooter of Jazz as he runs on a speedway with the purpose of gathering as many blue diamonds as requested before time runs out while obstacles try to stop him or slow him down If the task is accomplished successfully the player is provided with an extra life Aside from bonuses Jazz also features secret levels that can be accessed in specific areas of other levels once in every episode Secret level signs feature the question mark instead of Devan s head portrait that must be shot The current level is then considered completed and the secret level embarks Levels themselves consist of an enormous grant area with numerous weapons and items to pick up One level however features a mini boss while the player assumes control of Jazz in his sidekick bird form Secret levels also feature a count up upon completion that provides the player with extra score points Plot The game is set in a fantasy world based on Aesop s The Tortoise and the Hare in which the enmity between tortoises and hares continues even after three thousand years An evil mastermind tortoise named Devan Shell begins conquering planets suppressing any native confrontation One of such planets Carrotus is home to a peaceful hare kingdom that once confronted by Shell is able to provide enough resistance to fend him off Enraged by his loss Devan decides to kidnap Carrotus princess Eva Earlong and hide her on a distant airbase of unknown location to use as ransom In response the king chooses to send Carrotus hero Jazz Jackrabbit a green hare with a blue LFG gun to various planets conquered by Devan that might contain clues to the location of Eva s imprisonment As Jazz travels through different worlds he gains new weapons and meets new enemies in his pursuit to rescue the princess and save Carrotus from Devan Shell and his army of Turtle Terrorists Jazz manages to find the secret airbase but Devan escapes with Eva Jazz later finds Devan s cloning machine In the end Jazz stops two battleships sent by Devan to attack Carrotus and finds the location of the princess but Devan escapes Development Jazz Jackrabbit
