Psyonix LLC is an American video game developer based in San Diego It was founded in by Dave Hagewood with the team of his Internet focused company WebSite Machines After canceling its first two projects Psyonix created VehicleMOD a mod that adds vehicles to Unreal Tournament The game s developer Epic Games subsequently hired the studio to recreate this gameplay for a game mode in Unreal Tournament Psyonix subsisted off contract work and released its first original game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars in The game was not as successful as anticipated but Hagewood held on to the game s concept and had a small team prototype a sequel while the rest of the company worked on further contract projects This sequel was released as Rocket League in and became a commercial success Epic Games acquired the studio in May History Foundation and VehicleMOD Psyonix was founded by Dave Hagewood a native of Charlotte North Carolina He had started programming in at the age of eight when he modified the dialog for a text adventure game lending him an advantage in this field at school In he abandoned his computer science degree and dropped out of college to establish ArrowWeb a web hosting company and later WebSite Machines which developed multimedia and Internet software Hagewood heavily invested in the Internet industry and operated his companies out of Satellite Beach Florida but faced great competition In his spare time he occasionally modded video games often with vehicles but was under the impression that making games for a living was an impossible dream Still in as the WebSite Machines team sought to transition to video game development Hagewood established Psyonix with them The company name was derived from his fascination with the concept of intelligence and the innate powers of the human mind Psyonix s first project was Proteus a vehicular combat game Unhappy with the game engine chosen for the undertaking it was quickly abandoned for the company to shift to Unreal Engine Its first Unreal Engine game was Vampire Hunter The Dark Prophecy an action game with first person exploration and third person melee The game was announced in but soon became too large in scope for its intended budget After the studio completed a demo and pitched it to potential publishers it briefly experimented with adding vehicles to the game Unreal Tournament something Hagewood felt it had been lacking After a few weeks of development the team felt the project had potential and shelved Vampire Hunter in its favor In December after several months of work Mark Rein of Epic Games the developer of Unreal Engine and Unreal Tournament called Hagewood to inquire about the status of Vampire Hunter Hagewood informed him about the studio s more recent work which it called VehicleMOD and Rein asked to be shown a prototype at the Game Developers Conference in March Until then Psyonix worked to include functioning prototypes for all vehicles and multiplayer support Impressed with this demo Epic Games sought further talks but wanted to see how quickly the project could progress Psyonix worked through three weeks of crunch and enlisted independent modders to create three maps for VehicleMOD Hagewood showcased the newer version at Epic Games offices in North Carolina and the company immediately signed Psyonix to develop this mod as a game mode for Unreal Tournament which became known as Onslaught Hagewood believed that working with Epic Games remotely from Florida would impact the mode s quality so he relocated Psyonix to Raleigh North Carolina later in Rein paid for the moving expenses Around the same time Hagewood abandoned his work in web hosting Contract work and first original games In Raleigh Psyonix consisted largely of Hagewood and interns hired from nearby universities To stay afloat the studio accepted contract work from Epic Games to help develop games in Unreal Engine including Gears of War and Unreal Tournament III Hagewood ultimately sought to move West and create original games with Psyonix In the team devised Track Addict a vehicle platform game with time trial stages partially inspired by the Tony Hawk s and SSX series of extreme sports video games The studio pitched the game to various publishers and agreed with Microsoft to release the game on the company s Xbox platform During the game s development one person put a soccer ball into a level which the team enjoyed so much that they decided to design the game around that instead Hagewood informed Microsoft about the change in direction and the two companies parted ways The game was ultimately released in for the PlayStation as Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars The team chose an unusually long name hoping that it would attract attention In the meantime SouthPeak Games had contracted Psyonix to develop Monster Madness Grave Danger an updated port of Monster Madness Battle for Suburbia which was released for the PlayStation in the same year While Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars broke even it attracted fewer players than anticipated and did not bring about a significant profit causing Psyonix to return to contract work Still Hagewood believed that the existing fanbase warranted Psyonix s next original game to be a sequel Out of employees he kept a handful working on such a title while the rest was engaged with contract work In December the studio and all of its employees moved from Raleigh to larger offices in San Diego near the city s Gaslamp Quarter Later contract projects included Whizzle a tech demo for the Unreal Development Kit and additional work on Bulletstorm Homefront Mass Effect and XCOM Enemy Unknown In November Psyonix released an original mobile shooter ARC Squadron for iOS An enhanced version ARC Squadron Redux came out for iOS and Android in October Rocket League and acquisition by Epic Games present Also in the sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars entered production With a budget of under US million Psyonix developed Rocket League over two years Hagewood argued that Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars was too hardcore leading to a change of pace for Rocket League The game was released to immediate success in July for Windows and the PlayStation It increased Psyonix s profits fold and brought in million within one year Psyonix quickly expanded to people by December and consequently moved to a larger office in the Columbia Place tower spanning square feet m across two floors Hagewood sought to grow the tech industry in San Diego such as through his investment in Zesty io The expanded team continued to support Rocket League through additional content and Psyonix partnered with Twitch a video game livestreaming service to establish the Rocket League Championship Series as the game s official esports tournament In April the studio began prototyping a mobile Rocket League spin off ultimately named Rocket League Sideswipe On May Epic Games announced its acquisition of Psyonix to undisclosed terms At the time the studio had employees and planned to continue supporting Rocket League From his proceeds of the sale Hagewood bought the Benetti Galaxy a metre ft superyacht and intended to invest in space tourism Epic Games published Rocket League Sideswipe for Android and iOS in November and Psyonix s Rocket Racing game mode for Fortnite in December Games developed Additional work Canceled Proteus Vampire Hunter The Dark Prophecy Nosgoth References External links Official website
