inspiration from the battle royale game PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds towards taking inspiration from Minecraft He called the meta game basically a blueprint and wrote that it could become a serious rival to Minecraft due to Fortnite s infrastructure and player base The meta game was expected to keep a healthy player base for Fortnite Polygon s Ben Kuchera wrote that the game is a powerful new tool and that sharing your own maps and game modes or just using the tools to create wild videos is going to go a long way toward keeping Fortnite fresh for the foreseeable future Players have recreated various structures in Fortnite Creative these include the Star Wars starship Millennium Falcon and Castle Black from Game of Thrones Others have used musical tiles which can be found inside
