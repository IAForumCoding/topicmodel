The British Broadcasting Corporation BBC is a British public service broadcaster headquartered at Broadcasting House in London England Originally established in as the British Broadcasting Company it evolved into its current state with its current name on New Year s Day The oldest and largest local and global broadcaster by stature and by number of employees the BBC employs over staff in total of whom approximately are in public sector broadcasting The BBC was established under a royal charter and operates under an agreement with the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport Its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee which is charged to all British households companies and organisations using any type of equipment to receive or record live television broadcasts or to use the BBC s streaming service iPlayer The fee is set by the British Government agreed by Parliament and is used to fund the BBC s radio TV and online services covering the nations and regions of the UK Since April it has also funded the BBC World Service launched in as the BBC Empire Service which broadcasts in languages and provides comprehensive TV radio and online services in Arabic and Persian Some of the BBC s revenue comes from its commercial subsidiary BBC Studios formerly BBC Worldwide which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC s international hour English language news services BBC News and from BBC com provided by BBC Global News Ltd In the company was awarded the Queen s Award for Enterprise in recognition of its international achievements in business Since its formation in the BBC has played a prominent role in British life and culture It is sometimes informally referred to as the Beeb or Auntie History The birth of British broadcasting to Britain s first live public broadcast was made from the factory of Marconi Company in Chelmsford in June It was sponsored by the Daily Mail s Alfred Harmsworth st Viscount Northcliffe and featured the famous Australian soprano Dame Nellie Melba The Melba broadcast caught the people s imagination and marked a turning point in the British public s attitude to radio However this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications By late the pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority the General Post Office GPO was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts But by the GPO had received nearly broadcast licence requests and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by wireless societies with over members Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers to be known as the British Broadcasting Company Ltd which was formed on October John Reith a Scottish Calvinist was appointed its general manager in December a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast L Stanton Jefferies was its first director of music The company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of BBC wireless receiving sets from approved domestic manufacturers To this day the BBC aims to follow the Reithian directive to inform educate and entertain From private company towards public service corporation to The financial arrangements soon proved inadequate Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets By mid discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the Sykes Committee The committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC s immediate financial distress and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO This was to be followed by a simple shillings licence fee to fund broadcasts The BBC s broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence as was the prohibition on advertising To avoid competition with newspapers Fleet Street persuaded the government to ban news bulletins before pm and the BBC was required to source all news from external wire services Mid found the future of broadcasting under further consideration this time by the Crawford committee By now the BBC under Reith s leadership had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified monopoly broadcasting service but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium and Reith was keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the United Kingdom general strike broke out in May The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production and with restrictions on news bulletins waived the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis The crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position On the one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently The government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM s own Although Winston Churchill in particular wanted to commandeer the BBC to use it to the best possible advantage Reith wrote that Stanley Baldwin s government wanted to be able to say that they did not commandeer the BBC but they know that they can trust us not to be really impartial Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government s objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing The resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith s home using one of Reith s soundbites inserted at the last moment or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the Labour Party and delayed a peace appeal by the Archbishop of Canterbury Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake s Jerusalem signifying that England had been saved While the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers Seaton has characterised the episode as the invention of modern propaganda in its British form Reith argued that trust gained by authentic impartial news could then be used Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself The BBC did well out of the crisis which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting and it was followed by the Government s acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non commercial Crown chartered organisation the British Broadcasting Corporation to The British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on January and Reith newly knighted was appointed its first director general To represent its purpose and stated values the new corporation adopted the coat of arms including the motto Nation shall speak peace unto Nation British radio audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC Reith an intensely moralistic executive was in full charge His goal was to broadcast All that is best in every department of human knowledge endeavour and achievement The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance Reith succeeded in building a high wall against an American style free for all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue There was no paid advertising on the BBC all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets Highbrow audiences however greatly enjoyed it At a time when American Australian and Canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball rugby and hockey the BBC emphasised service for a national rather than a regional audience Boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing but the BBC was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games regardless of their popularity John Reith and the BBC with support from the Crown determined the universal needs of the people of Britain and broadcast content according to these perceived standards Reith effectively censored anything that he felt would be harmful directly or indirectly While recounting his time with the BBC in Raymond Postgate claims that BBC broadcasters were made to submit a draft of their potential broadcast for approval It was expected that they tailored their content to accommodate the modest church going elderly or a member of the Clergy Until entertainers broadcasting on the BBC both singers and talkers were expected to avoid biblical quotations Clerical impersonations and references references to drink or Prohibition in the United States vulgar and doubtful matter and political allusions The BBC excluded popular foreign music and musicians from its broadcasts while promoting British alternatives On March Stanley Baldwin the Prime Minister maintained the censorship of editorial opinions on public policy but allowed the BBC to address matters of religious political or industrial controversy The resulting political talk series designed to inform England on political issues were criticised by members of parliament including Winston Churchill David Lloyd George and Sir Austen Chamberlain Those who opposed these chats claimed that they silence the opinions of those in Parliament who are not nominated by Party Leaders or Party Whips thus stifling independent non official views In October the policemen of the Metropolitan Police Federation marched in protest at a proposed pay cut Fearing dissent within the police force and public support for the movement the BBC censored its coverage of the events only broadcasting official statements from the government Throughout the s political broadcasts had been closely monitored by the BBC In the BBC censored the broadcasts of Oswald Mosley and Harry Pollitt Mosley was a leader of the British Union of Fascists and Pollitt a leader of the Communist Party of Great Britain They had been contracted to provide a series of five broadcasts on their parties politics The BBC in conjunction with The Foreign Office of Britain first suspended this series and ultimately cancelled it without the notice of the public Less radical politicians faced similar censorship In Winston Churchill proposed a series of talks regarding British domestic and foreign politics and affairs but was similarly censored The censorship of political discourse by the BBC was a precursor to the total shutdown of political debate that manifested over the BBC s wartime airwaves The Foreign Office maintained that the public should not be aware of their role in the censorship From to the BBC also attempted to unite the British Empire s radio waves sending staff to Egypt Palestine Newfoundland Jamaica India Canada and South Africa Reith personally visited South Africa lobbying for state run radio programmes which was accepted by South African Parliament in A similar programme was adopted in Canada Through collaboration with these state run broadcasting centres Reith left a legacy of cultural influence across the empire of Great Britain with his departure from the corporation in Experimental television broadcasts were started in using an electromechanical line system developed by John Logie Baird Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in and an expanded service now named the BBC Television Service started from Alexandra Palace in November alternating between an improved Baird mechanical line system and the all electronic line Marconi EMI system which had been developed by an EMI research team led by Sir Isaac Shoenberg The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year with the Marconi EMI system the first fully electronic television system in the world to be used in regular broadcasting BBC versus other media The success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the BBC and well established media such as theatres concert halls and the recording industry By the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting because they feared it harmed the artist by making his material stale and that it reduces the value of the artist as a visible music hall performer On the other hand the BBC was keenly interested in a cooperation with the recording companies who in recent years have not been slow to make records of singers orchestras dance bands etc who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received manuscripts by most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting Day in and day out manuscripts come in and nearly all go out again through the post with a note saying We regret etc In the s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity for example the friendly and wide ranging BBC Theatre Organ broadcasts at St George s Hall London by Reginald Foort who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from to Second World War Television broadcasting was suspended from September to June during the World War II and it was left to BBC Radio broadcasters such as Reginald Foort to keep the nation s spirits up The BBC moved most of its radio operations out of London initially to Bristol and then to Bedford Concerts were broadcast from the Bedford Corn Exchange the Trinity Chapel in St Paul s Church Bedford was the studio for the daily service from to and in the darkest days of the war in the Archbishops of Canterbury and York came to St Paul s to broadcast to the UK and the world on the National Day of Prayer BBC employees during the war included George Orwell who spent two years with the broadcaster During his role as prime minister during the war Winston Churchill delivered major wartime speeches by radio all of which were carried by the BBC within the UK On June French general Charles de Gaulle in exile in London as the leader of the Free French made a speech broadcast by the BBC urging the French people not to capitulate to the Nazis In October Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made their first radio broadcast for the BBC s Children s Hour addressing other children who had been evacuated from cities In John Reith and the Government of the United Kingdom specifically the Ministry of Information which had been set up for WWII designed a censorship apparatus for the inevitability of war Due to the BBC s advancements in shortwave radio technology the corporation could broadcast across the world during the Second World War Within Europe the BBC European Service would gather intelligence and information regarding the current events of the war in English Regional BBC workers based on their regional geo political climate would then further censor the material their broadcasts would cover Nothing was to be added outside the preordained news items For example the BBC Polish Service was heavily censored due to fears of jeopardising relations with the Soviet Union Controversial topics i e the contested Polish and Soviet border the deportation of Polish citizens the arrests of Polish Home Army members and the Katyn massacre were not included in Polish broadcasts American radio broadcasts were broadcast across Europe on BBC channels This material also passed through the BBC s censorship office which surveilled and edited American coverage of British affairs By across all BBC broadcasts music by composers from enemy nations was censored In total German Austrian and Italian composers were censored The BBC argued that like the Italian or German languages listeners would be irritated by the inclusion of enemy composers Any potential broadcasters said to have pacifist communist or fascist ideologies were not allowed on the BBC s airwaves In a MI security officer was given a permanent office within the organisation This officer would examine the files of potential political subversives and mark the files of those deemed a security risk to the organisation blacklisting them This was often done on spurious grounds even so the practice would continue and expand during the years of the Cold War Later th century There was a widely reported urban myth that upon resumption of the BBC television service after the war announcer Leslie Mitchell started by saying As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted In fact the first person to appear when transmission resumed was Jasmine Bligh and the words said were Good afternoon everybody How are you Do you remember me Jasmine Bligh The European Broadcasting Union was formed on February in Torquay with the BBC among the founding broadcasting organisations Competition to the BBC was introduced in with the commercial and independently operated television network of Independent Television ITV However the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist until October when under the control of the newly renamed Independent Broadcasting Authority IBA the UK s first Independent local radio station LBC came on air in the London area As a result of the Pilkington Committee report of in which the BBC was praised for the quality and range of its output and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming the decision was taken to award the BBC a second television channel BBC in renaming the existing service BBC BBC used the higher resolution line standard which had been standardised across Europe BBC was broadcast in colour from July and was joined by BBC and ITV on November The line VHF transmissions of BBC and ITV were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until Starting in a series of pirate radio stations starting with Radio Caroline came on the air and forced the British government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising financed services In response the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels On September the Light Programme was split into Radio offering continuous Popular music and Radio more Easy Listening The Third programme became Radio offering classical music and cultural programming The Home Service became Radio offering news and non musical content such as quiz shows readings dramas and plays As well as the four national channels a series of local BBC radio stations were established in including Radio London In the BBC Enterprises department was formed to exploit BBC brands and programmes for commercial spin off products In it became a wholly owned limited company BBC Enterprises Ltd In the BBC s teletext service Ceefax was introduced created initially to provide subtitling but developed into a news and information service In BBC staff went on strike just before the Christmas thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one Since the deregulation of the UK television and radio market in the s the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector and from the advertiser funded public service broadcaster Channel especially on satellite television cable television and digital television services In the late s the BBC began a process of divestment by spinning off and selling parts of its organisation In it sold off the Hulton Press Library a photographic archive which had been acquired from the Picture Post magazine by the BBC in The archive was sold to Brian Deutsch and is now owned by Getty Images In the BBC decided to centralize its operations by the management team with the radio and television divisions joining forces together for the first time the activities of the news and currents departments and coordinated jointly under the new directorate During the s this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but wholly owned subsidiaries with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme making BBC Enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in as BBC Worldwide Ltd In BBC studios outside broadcasts post production design costumes and wigs were spun off into BBC Resources Ltd The BBC Research Development has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques The BBC was also responsible for the development of the NICAM stereo standard In recent decades a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched Radio was launched in as a sports and educational station but was replaced in with BBC Radio Live to become a live radio station following the success of the Radio service to cover the Gulf War The new station would be a news and sport station In BBC News a rolling news channel launched on digital television services and the following year BBC Choice was launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel which was renamed BBC Parliament In BBC Knowledge launched as a multimedia channel with services available on the newly launched BBC Text digital teletext service later rebranded as BBC Red Button and on BBC Online The channel had an educational aim which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries to In several television and radio channels were reorganised BBC Knowledge was replaced by BBC Four and became the BBC s arts and documentaries channel CBBC which had been a programming strand as Children s BBC since was split into CBBC and CBeebies for younger children with both new services getting a digital channel the CBBC Channel and CBeebies Channel In addition to the television channels new digital radio stations were created Xtra Music and Radio Extra BBC Xtra was a sister station to Radio and specialised in modern black music BBC Music specialised in alternative music genres and BBC specialised in archive speech and children s programming The following few years resulted in repositioning of some channels to conform to a larger brand in BBC Choice was replaced by BBC Three with programming for younger adults and shocking real life documentaries BBC News became the BBC News Channel in and BBC Radio became BBC Radio Extra in with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on Radio In another channel was launched BBC Alba a Scottish Gaelic service During this decade the corporation began to sell off a number of its operational divisions to private owners BBC Broadcast was spun off as a separate company in and in it was sold off to Australian based Macquarie Capital Alliance Group and Macquarie Group Limited and rebranded Red Bee Media The BBC s IT telephony and broadcast technology were brought together as BBC Technology Ltd in and the division was later sold to the German company Siemens IT Solutions and Services SIS SIS was subsequently acquired from Siemens by the French company Atos Further divestments included BBC Books sold to Random House in BBC Outside Broadcasts Ltd sold in to Satellite Information Services Costumes and Wigs stock sold in to Angels Costumes and BBC Magazines sold to Immediate Media Company in After the sales of OBs and costumes the remainder of BBC Resources was reorganised as BBC Studios and Post Production which continues today as a wholly owned subsidiary of the BBC The Hutton Inquiry and the subsequent report raised questions about the BBC s journalistic standards and its impartiality This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General Greg Dyke In January the BBC released minutes of the board meeting which led to Greg Dyke s resignation Unlike the other departments of the BBC the BBC World Service was funded by the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office The Foreign and Commonwealth Office more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad A strike in by more than BBC workers over a proposal to cut jobs and to privatise parts of the BBC disrupted much of the BBC s regular programming In BBC HD launched as an experimental service and became official in December The channel broadcast HD simulcasts of programmes on BBC One BBC Two BBC Three and BBC Four as well as repeats of some older programmes in HD In an HD simulcast of BBC One launched BBC One HD The channel uses HD versions of BBC One s schedule and uses upscaled versions of programmes not currently produced in HD The BBC HD channel closed in March and was replaced by BBC Two HD in the same month On October BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the BBC as an organisation The plans included a reduction in posts of including redundancies consolidating news operations reducing programming output by and selling off the flagship Television Centre building in London These plans were fiercely opposed by unions who threatened a series of strikes however the BBC stated that the cuts were essential to move the organisation forward and concentrate on increasing the quality of programming On October the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced that the television licence fee would be frozen at its current level until the end of the current charter in The same announcement revealed that the BBC would take on the full cost of running the BBC World Service and the BBC Monitoring service from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and partially finance the Welsh broadcaster S C to present Further cuts were announced on October so the BBC could reach a total reduction in their budget of following the licence fee freeze in October which included cutting staff by and sending a further to the MediaCityUK development in Salford with BBC Three moving online only in the sharing of more programmes between stations and channels sharing of radio news bulletins more repeats in schedules including the whole of BBC Two daytime and for some original programming to be reduced BBC HD was closed on March and replaced with an HD simulcast of BBC Two however flagship programmes other channels and full funding for CBBC and CBeebies would be retained Numerous BBC facilities have been sold off including New Broadcasting House on Wilmslow Road in Manchester Many major departments have been relocated to Broadcasting House in central London and MediaCityUK in Salford particularly since the closure of BBC Television Centre in March On February the BBC Three television service was discontinued and replaced by a digital outlet under the same name targeting its young adult audience with web series and other content Under the new royal charter instituted in the corporation must publish an annual report to Ofcom outlining its plans and public service obligations for the next year In its report released July the BBC announced plans to re invent its output to better compete against commercial streaming services such as Netflix These plans included increasing the diversity of its content on television and radio a major increase in investments towards digital children s content and plans to make larger investments in Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland to rise to the challenge of better reflecting and representing a changing UK Since the BBC has also funded the Local Democracy Reporting Service with up to journalists employed by independent news organisations to report on local democracy issues on a pooled basis In the BBC Director General Tony Hall announced a savings target of million per year by which is about of annual licence fee revenue Having to take on the million cost for free TV licences for the over pensioners and rapid inflation in drama and sport coverage costs was given as the reason Duplication of management and content spending would be reduced and there would be a review of BBC News In September the BBC launched the Trusted News Initiative to work with news and social media companies to combat disinformation about national elections In the BBC announced a BBC News savings target of million per year by involving about staff reductions The BBC s director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth said there would be further moves toward digital broadcasting in part to attract back a youth audience and more pooling of reporters to stop separate teams covering the same news In the BBC reported a million deficit because of delays to cost reduction plans and the forthcoming ending of the remaining million funding towards pensioner licence fees would increase financial pressures In January it was reported that former banker Richard Sharp would succeed David Clementi as chairman when he stepped down in February In March the BBC was at the centre of a political row with football pundit Gary Lineker after he criticised the British government s asylum policy on social media Lineker was suspended from his position on Match of the Day before being re instated after receiving overwhelming support from his colleagues The scandal was made worse due to the connections between BBC s chairman Richard Sharp and the Conservative Party In April Richard Sharp resigned as chairman after a report found he did not disclose potential perceived conflicts of interest in his role in the facilitation of a loan to Prime Minister Boris Johnson Dame Elan Closs Stephens was appointed as acting chairwoman on June and she would lead the BBC board for a year or until a new permanent chair has been appointed Samir Shah was subsequently appointed with effect from March Governance The BBC is a statutory corporation independent from direct government intervention with its activities being overseen from April by the BBC Board and regulated by Ofcom The chairman is

policy From as early as the s until the s MI the British domestic intelligence service engaged in the vetting of applicants for BBC jobs a policy designed to keep out persons deemed subversive In BBC executive Colonel Alan Dawnay began to meet the head of MI Sir Vernon Kell to informally trade information from a formal arrangement was made whereby job applicants would be secretly vetted by MI for their political views without their knowledge The BBC took up a policy of denying any suggestion by the press of such a relationship the very existence of MI itself was not officially acknowledged until the Security Service Act This relationship garnered wider public attention after an article by David Leigh and Paul Lashmar appeared in The Observer in August revealing that MI had been vetting appointments running operations from Room in Broadcasting House At the time of the expos the operation was being run by Ronnie Stonham A memo from revealed that blacklisted organisations included the far left Communist Party of Great Britain the Socialist Workers Party the Workers Revolutionary Party and the Militant tendency as well as the far right National Front and the British National Party An association with one of these groups could result in a denial of a job application In October the BBC announced that it would stop the vetting process except for a few people in top roles as well as those in charge of Wartime Broadcasting Service emergency broadcasting in the event of a nuclear war and staff of the BBC World Service In following the Security Service Act vetting was further restricted to those responsible for wartime broadcasting and those with access to secret government information Michael Hodder who succeeded Stonham had the MI vetting files sent to the BBC Archives in Reading Berkshire Finances The BBC has the second largest budget of any UK based broadcaster with an operating expenditure of billion in compared with billion for Sky UK in and billion for ITV in the calendar year Revenue The principal means of funding the BBC is through the television licence costing per year per household since April Such a licence is required to legally receive broadcast television across the UK the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man No licence is required to own a television used for other means or for sound only radio sets though a separate licence for these was also required for non TV households until The cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law A discount is available for households with only black and white television sets A discount is also offered to people who are registered blind or severely visually impaired and the licence is completely free for any household containing anyone aged or over However from August the licence fee will only be waived if over and receiving pension credit The BBC pursues its licence fee collection and enforcement under the trading name TV Licensing The revenue is collected privately by Capita an outside agency and is paid into the central government Consolidated Fund a process defined in the Communications Act Funds are then allocated by the Department for Culture Media and Sport DCMS and the Treasury and approved by Parliament via legislation Additional revenues are paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for eligible over year olds The licence fee is classified as a tax and its evasion is a criminal offence Since collection and enforcement of the licence fee has been the responsibility of the BBC in its role as TV Licensing Authority The BBC carries out surveillance mostly using subcontractors on properties under the auspices of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act and may conduct searches of a property using a search warrant According to TV Licensing people in the UK were caught watching TV without a licence in Licence fee evasion makes up around one tenth of all cases prosecuted in magistrates courts representing of court time Income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years with BBC Worldwide contributing some million to the BBC s core public service business According to the BBC s Annual Report its total income was billion a decrease from billion in partly owing to a phased reduction in government funding for free over s TV licences which can be broken down as follows billion in licence fees collected from householders billion from the BBC s commercial businesses and government grants some of which will cease in The licence fee has however attracted criticism It has been argued that in an age of multi stream multi channel availability an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate The BBC s use of private sector company Capita to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments or do not require a TV licence The BBC uses advertising campaigns to inform customers of the requirement to pay the licence fee Past campaigns have been criticised by Conservative MP Boris Johnson and former MP Ann Widdecombe for having a threatening nature and language used to scare evaders into paying Audio clips and television broadcasts are used to inform listeners of the BBC s comprehensive database There are a number of pressure groups campaigning on the issue of the licence fee The majority of the BBC s commercial output comes from its commercial arm BBC Worldwide which sell programmes abroad and exploit key brands for merchandise Of their sales were centred on the five key superbrands of Doctor Who Top Gear Strictly Come Dancing known as Dancing with the Stars internationally the BBC s archive of natural history programming collected under the umbrella of BBC Earth and the now sold travel guide brand Lonely Planet Assets Broadcasting House in Portland Place central London is the official headquarters of the BBC It is home to six of the ten BBC national radio networks BBC Radio BBC Radio xtra BBC Asian Network BBC Radio BBC Radio and BBC Radio Extra It is also the home of BBC News which relocated to the building from BBC Television Centre in On the front of the building are statues of Prospero and Ariel characters from William Shakespeare s play The Tempest sculpted by Eric Gill Renovation of Broadcasting House began in and was completed in Until it closed at the end of March BBC Television was based at Television Centre a purpose built television facility opened in located in White City four miles km west of central London This facility was host to a number of famous guests and programmes through the years and its name and image is familiar with many British citizens Nearby the White City Place complex contains numerous programme offices housed in Centre House the Media Centre and Broadcast Centre It is in this area around Shepherd s Bush that the majority of BBC employees worked As part of a major reorganisation of BBC property the entire BBC News operation relocated from the News Centre at BBC Television Centre to the refurbished Broadcasting House to create what is being described as one of the world s largest live broadcast centres The BBC News Channel and BBC News International relocated to the premises in early Broadcasting House is now also home to most of the BBC s national radio stations and the BBC World Service The major part of this plan involved the demolition of the two post war extensions to the building and construction of an extension designed by Sir Richard MacCormac of MJP Architects This move concentrated the BBC s London operations allowing them to sell Television Centre In addition to the scheme above the BBC is in the process of making and producing more programmes outside London involving production centres such as Belfast Cardiff Glasgow Newcastle and most notably in Greater Manchester as part of the BBC North Project scheme where several major departments including BBC North West BBC Manchester BBC Sport BBC Children s CBeebies Radio Live BBC Radio Sports Extra BBC Breakfast BBC Learning and the BBC Philharmonic have all moved from their previous locations in either London or New Broadcasting House Manchester to the new acre ha MediaCityUK production facilities in Salford that form part of the large BBC North Group division and will therefore become the biggest staffing operation outside London As well as the two main sites in London Broadcasting House and White City there are seven other important BBC production centres in the UK mainly specialising in different productions Cardiff is home to BBC Cymru Wales which specialises in drama production Open since and containing new studios Roath Lock is notable as the home of productions such as Doctor Who and Casualty Broadcasting House Belfast home to BBC Northern Ireland specialises in original drama and comedy and has taken part in many co productions with independent companies and notably with RT in the Republic of Ireland BBC Scotland based in Pacific Quay Glasgow is a large producer of programmes for the network including several quiz shows In England the larger regions also produce some programming Previously the largest hub of BBC programming from the regions is BBC North West At present they produce all religious and ethical programmes on the BBC as well as other programmes such as A Question of Sport However this is to be merged and expanded under the BBC North project which involved the region moving from New Broadcasting House Manchester to MediaCityUK BBC Midlands based at Mailbox Birmingham also produces drama and contains the headquarters for the English regions and the BBC s daytime output Other production centres include Broadcasting House Bristol home of BBC West and famously the BBC Studios Natural History Unit and to a lesser extent Quarry Hill in Leeds home of BBC Yorkshire There are also many smaller local and regional studios throughout the UK operating the BBC regional television services and the BBC Local Radio stations The BBC also operates several news gathering centres in various locations around the world which provide news coverage of that region to the national and international news operations Information technology service management In the BBC contracted out its former BBC Technology division to the German engineering and electronics company Siemens IT Solutions and Services SIS outsourcing its IT telephony and broadcast technology systems When Atos Origin acquired the SIS division from Siemens in December for million m the BBC support contract also passed to Atos and in July the BBC announced to staff that its technology support would become an Atos service Siemens staff working on the BBC contract were transferred to Atos the BBC s Information Technology systems are now managed by Atos In the BBC s chief financial officer Zarin Patel stated to the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee that following criticism of the BBC s management of major IT projects with Siemens such as the Digital Media Initiative the BBC partnership with Atos would be instrumental in achieving cost savings of around million as part of the BBC s Delivering

Local Radio BBC services in the dependencies are financed from television licence fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the UK although collected locally This is the subject of some controversy in the Isle of Man since as well as having no BBC Local Radio service the island also lacks a local television news service analogous to that provided by BBC Channel Islands For a
