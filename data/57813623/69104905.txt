Facing Worlds also known by its filename CTF Face is a multiplayer map for the first person shooter video games Unreal Tournament Unreal Tournament Unreal Tournament Unreal Tournament and Unreal Tournament Consisting of two identical towers separated by a bridge each team must fight their way into the opposing team s tower and capture their flag The original Unreal Tournament version of Facing Worlds received critical acclaim and is widely regarded as one of the greatest first person shooter maps of all time Design Facing Worlds originally appeared in Unreal Tournament The map is set in space on a small asteroid in orbit over Earth As a Capture the Flag map players are divided into two teams with each team spawning near a tower containing their team s flag The towers are connected by a two lane bridge with a large gap separating the lanes The goal of the map is for each team to retrieve the opposing team s flag and deliver it to their own team s tower Facing Worlds creator Cedric Fiorentino referred to the map s architecture as vaguely Mayan but not too recognizable Development Facing Worlds was created by Fiorentino as a test of the Unreal Engine s capabilities According to Fiorentino typical Unreal Tournament maps had a limit of polygons visible at the same time which were split evenly between the landscape and map structures By contrast Facing Worlds development began with Fiorentino allocating all polygons to buildings and leaving the landscape for later After building the initial tower Fiorentino duplicated it linked the towers by a bridge and began gameplay testing As a result of Facing World s polygon budget being exhausted on its dual towers a traditional landscape was omitted in favor of having the map take place in space with Fiorentino employing an animated skybox to give the impression that the map is in a chaotic orbit above the Earth Foregone Destruction the song that plays ingame within Facing Worlds was written with minimal collaboration between Fiorentino and the co composer of Unreal Tournament s soundtrack Michiel van den Bos Van den Bos mostly relied on text explanations of Unreal Tournament when composing its soundtrack as he didn t have appropriate hardware to run the game itself In explaining the origins of the track van den Bos said I was and still am very fond of Drum n Bass and since I hadn t heard it in games before I thought I d give it a shot Reception Facing Worlds is frequently listed as one of the greatest multiplayer maps of all time According to Fiorentino telemetry for Unreal Tournament revealed that Facing Worlds was played more than all other Capture the Flag levels combined Andy Kelly of PC Gamer deemed Facing Worlds the greatest multiplayer map in a retrospective praising the map for its beautifully simple design Speaking of his time playing Facing Worlds at LAN parties Kevin Wong of Kotaku regarded the map as being so well designed so carefully constructed that every other CTF map paled in comparison Peter Glagowski of Destructoid commented that it is hard to understate the mastery of design that is CTF Face praising the map for encouraging teamwork and playstyle diversity without sacrificing its simplicity Legacy Facing Worlds has appeared in all subsequent Unreal Tournament games including Unreal Tournament Unreal Tournament Unreal Tournament and Unreal Tournament Facing Worlds has also been remade as a custom map for other games such as Counter Strike Global Offensive and Halo Guardians A map from Splitgate called Foregone Destruction is a direct homage to Facing Worlds Posters featuring the map can be found inside houses on the island in the later Epic Games release Fortnite Battle Royale alongside other posters for their titles Jazz Jackrabbit and One Must Fall References
