title: Parachuting
id: 19723982
Parachuting and skydiving is a method of transiting from a high point in an atmosphere to the ground or ocean surface with the aid of gravity involving the control of speed during the descent using a parachute or parachutes For human skydiving it may involve a phase of more or less free falling the skydiving segment which is a period when the parachute has not yet been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to terminal velocity For cargo parachuting the parachute descent may begin immediately such as a parachute airdrop in the lower atmosphere of Earth or be significantly delayed such as in a planetary atmosphere where an object is descending under parachute following atmospheric entry from space and may begin only after the hypersonic entry phase and initial deceleration that occurs due to friction with the thin upper atmosphere History The first parachute jump in history was made on October by Frenchman Andr Jacques Garnerin above Parc Monceau Paris He used a silk parachute to descend approximately feet m from a hot air balloon Common uses Parachuting is performed as a recreational activity and a competitive sport and is widely considered an extreme sport due to the risks involved In there were million jumps in the US Modern militaries utilize parachuting for the deployment of airborne forces and supplies Special operations forces commonly employ parachuting especially free fall parachuting as a method of insertion Occasionally forest firefighters known as smokejumpers in the United States use parachuting as a means of rapidly inserting themselves near forest fires in especially remote or otherwise inaccessible areas Manually exiting an aircraft and parachuting to safety has been widely used by aviators especially military aviators and aircrew and passengers to escape an aircraft that could not otherwise land safely While this method of escape is relatively rare in modern times it was occasionally used in World War I by German military aviators and utilized extensively throughout the air wars of World War II In modern times the most common means of escape from an aircraft in distress is via an ejection seat Said system is usually operated by the pilot aircrew member or passenger by engaging an activation device manually In most designs this will lead to the seat being propelled out of and away from the aircraft carrying the occupant with it by means of either an explosive charge or a rocket propulsion system Once clear of the aircraft the ejection seat will deploy a parachute although some older models entrusted this step to manual activation by the seat s occupant Safety In the U S during the s the sport averaged fatalities annually In the s the average dropped to and in the s the average decreased to deaths per year Between and the average dropped to and over the eight years after the annual average declined to fatalities roughly fatalities per one million jumps In members of one organization the United States Parachute Association USPA reported skydiving injuries sufficiently severe to require resort to a medical care facility In the US and in most of the western world skydivers are required to wear two parachutes The reserve parachute must be periodically inspected and repacked whether used or not by a certified parachute rigger in the US an FAA certificated parachute rigger every days Many skydivers use an automatic activation device AAD that opens the reserve parachute at a predetermined altitude if it detects that the skydiver is still in free fall Depending on the country AADs are often mandatory for new jumpers and or required for all jumpers regardless of their experience level Some skydivers wear a visual altimeter and some use audible altimeters fitted to their helmets Unsafe maneuvers Injuries and fatalities occurring under a fully functional parachute usually happen because the skydiver performed unsafe maneuvers or made an error in judgement while flying their canopy typically resulting in a high speed impact with the ground or other hazards on the ground One of the most common sources of injury is a low turn under a high performance canopy and while swooping Swooping is the advanced discipline of gliding at high speed parallel to the ground during landing Winds Changing wind conditions are another risk factor In conditions of strong winds and turbulence during hot days the parachutist can be caught in downdrafts close to the ground Shifting winds can cause a crosswind or downwind landing which have a higher potential for injury due to the wind speed adding to the landing speed Canopy collisions Another risk factor is that of canopy collisions or collisions between two or more skydivers under fully inflated parachutes Canopy collisions can cause the jumpers inflated parachutes to entangle with each other often resulting in a sudden collapse deflation of one or more of the involved parachutes When this occurs the jumpers often must quickly perform emergency procedures if there is sufficient altitude to do so to cut away jettison from their main canopies and deploy their reserve canopies Canopy collisions are particularly dangerous when occurring at altitudes too low to allow the jumpers adequate time to safely jettison their main parachutes and fully deploy their reserve parachutes Equipment failure Equipment failure may contribute to fatalities and injuries Approximately one in deployments of a main parachute result in a malfunction Ram air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably when malfunctioning and must be jettisoned before deploying the reserve parachute Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently they are also designed more conservatively and built and tested to more exacting standards so they are more reliable than main parachutes but the real safety advantage comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction although the possibility of a main malfunction that cannot be cut away causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk Static line failures pose risks of towed paratroopers Base jumping Parachuting disciplines such as BASE jumping or those that involve equipment such as wingsuit flying and sky surfing have a higher risk factor due to the lower mobility of the jumper and the greater risk of entanglement For this reason these disciplines are generally practised by experienced jumpers USPA member drop zones in the US and Canada are required to have an experienced jumper act as a safety officer in Canada DSO Drop Zone Safety Officer in the U S S TA Safety and Training Advisor who is responsible for dealing with jumpers who violate rules regulations or otherwise act in a fashion deemed unsafe by the appointed individual In many countries either the local regulations or the liability conscious prudence of the drop zone owners require that parachutists must have attained the age of majority before engaging in the sport The first skydive performed without a parachute was by stuntman Gary Connery on May at m Most common injuries Due to the hazardous nature of skydiving precautions are taken to avoid parachuting injuries and death For first time solo parachutists this includes anywhere from to hours of ground instruction Since the majority of parachute injuries occur upon landing approximately the greatest emphasis within ground training is usually on the proper parachute landing fall PLF which seeks to orient the body so as to evenly disperse the impact through flexion of several large insulating muscles such as the medial gastrocnemius tibialis anterior rectus femoris vastus medialis biceps femoris and semitendinosus as opposed to individual bones tendons and ligaments which break and tear more easily Parachutists especially those flying smaller sport canopies often land with dangerous amounts of kinetic energy and for this reason improper landings are the cause of more than of all skydiving related injuries and deaths Often injuries sustained during parachute landing are caused when a single outstretched limb such as a hand or foot is extended separately from the rest of the body causing it to sustain forces disproportional to the support structures within This tendency is displayed in the accompanying chart which shows the significantly higher proportion of wrist and ankle injuries among the injured in a parachute jump study Due to the possibility of fractures commonly occurring on the tibia and the ankle mortise it is recommended that parachutists wear supportive footwear Supportive footwear prevents inward and outward ankle rolling allowing the PLF to safely transfer impact energy through the true ankle joint and dissipate it via the medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles Weather Parachuting in poor weather especially with thunderstorms high winds and dust devils can be a more dangerous activity Reputable drop zones will suspend normal operations during inclement weather In the United States the USPA s Basic Safety Requirements prohibit solo student skydivers from jumping in winds exceeding mph while using ram air equipment However maximum ground winds are unlimited for licensed skydivers Visibility As parachuting is an aviation activity under the visual flight rules it is generally illegal to jump in or through clouds according to the relevant rules governing the airspace such as FAR in the US or Faldsk rmsbestemmelser Parachuting Ordinances in Denmark Jumpers and pilots of the dropping aircraft similarly bear responsibility of following the other VFR elements in particular ensuring that the air traffic at the moment of jump does not create a hazard Canopy collisions A collision with another canopy is a statistical hazard and may be avoided by observing simple principles including knowing upper wind speeds the number of party members and exit groups and having sufficient exit separation between jumpers In of all skydiving fatalities in the United States resulted from mid air collisions Training Skydiving can be practised without jumping Vertical wind tunnels are used to practise for free fall indoor skydiving or bodyflight while virtual reality parachute simulators are used to practise parachute control Beginning skydivers seeking training have the following options Tandem Tandem skydiving or tandem parachuting refers to a type of skydiving where a student skydiver is connected to an instructor via a harness The instructor guides the student through the whole jump from exit through freefall piloting the canopy and landing The student needs only minimal instruction before making a tandem jump with the instructor Static line A static line is a fixed cord attached to a large stable object It is used to open parachutes automatically for paratroopers and novice parachutists Instructor assisted deployment IAD Instructor assisted deployment IAD is a parachute deployment program most adequately similar to static line The main difference is that instead of being deployed by a static line the student s jumpmaster who is in the plane with them deploys the student s parachute by throwing the pilot chute downward and clear of the door as the student exits Accelerated freefall Accelerated freefall AFF known in Canada as progressive freefall and in Finland as Nova NOpeutettu VApaapudotus a literal translation is a method of training for skydiving called accelerated because the progression is the fastest way to experience solo freefall normally from to feet above ground level AGL allowing one to reach a higher terminal velocity than normal In AFF one or sometimes two instructor s are dedicated to just one student causing this method of training to be more expensive than static line progression where one instructor can dispatch multiple students per load initially from a lower altitude Parachute deployment At a sport skydiver s deployment altitude the individual manually deploys a small pilot chute which acts as a drogue catching air and pulling out the main parachute or the main canopy There are two principal systems in use the throw out where the skydiver pulls a toggle attached to the top of the pilot chute stowed in a small pocket outside the main container and the pull out where the skydiver pulls a small pad attached to the pilot chute which is stowed inside the container Throw out pilot chute pouches are usually positioned at the bottom of the container the B O C deployment system but older harnesses often have leg mounted pouches The latter are safe for flat flying but often unsuitable for freestyle or head down flying In a typical civilian sport parachute system the pilot chute is connected to a line known as the bridle which in turn is attached to a small deployment bag that contains the folded parachute and the canopy suspension lines which are stowed with rubber bands At the bottom of the container that holds the deployment bag is a closing loop which during packing is fed through the grommets of the four flaps that are used to close the container At that point a curved pin that is attached to the bridle is inserted through the closing loop The next step involves folding the pilot chute and placing it in a pouch e g B O C pouch Activation begins when the pilot chute is thrown out It inflates and creates drag pulling the pin out of the closing loop and allowing the pilot chute to pull the deployment bag from the container The parachute lines are pulled loose from the rubber bands and extend as the canopy starts to open A rectangular piece of fabric called the slider which separates the parachute lines into four main groups fed through grommets in the four respective corners of the slider slows the opening of the parachute and works its way down until the canopy is fully open and the slider is just above the head of the skydiver The slider slows and controls the deployment of the parachute Without a slider the parachute would inflate fast potentially damaging the parachute fabric and or suspension lines as well as causing discomfort injury or even death of the jumper During a normal deployment a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration in the realm of to g while the parachute slows the descent from km h mph to approximately km h mph If a skydiver experiences a malfunction of their main parachute which they cannot correct they pull a cut away handle on the front right hand side of their harness on the chest which will release the main canopy from the harness container Once free from the malfunctioning main canopy the reserve canopy can be activated manually by pulling a second handle on the front left harness Some containers are fitted with a connecting line from the main to reserve parachutes known as a reserve static line RSL which pulls open the reserve container faster than a manual release could Whichever method is used a spring loaded pilot chute then extracts the reserve parachute from the upper half of the container Competitions World Championships are held every two years both Indoor and Outdoor in the competition disciplines Artistic Events Freestyle and Freefly indoor and outdoor Canopy Formation outdoor only Canopy Piloting outdoor only Dynamic indoor only Formation Skydiving indoor and outdoor Paraski outdoor only Style Accuracy Landing outdoor only and Wingsuit Flying outdoor only Continental Championships and World Cups can be held in alternate years Artistic events There are now two competitive Artistic Events Freestyle and Freefly Freestyle teams consist of a performer and a videographer Freefly teams have two performers and a videographer Skysurfing is no longer a competitive event after insufficient competitors entered in two successive World Championships The history of these events is on this Freeflying page Accuracy landing Often called Classic accuracy this is an individual or team contest performed under an open parachute The aim is to touch down on a target whose center is cm in diameter The target can be a deep foam mattress or an air filled landing pad An electronic recording pad of cm in diameter is set in the middle It measures score in cm increments up to cm and displays result just after landing The first part of any competition takes place over rounds Then in the individual competition after these selective rounds the top jump a semi final round After the semi final round the top are selected for the final round The competitor with the lowest cumulative score is declared the winner Competitors jump in teams of maximum exiting the aircraft at or meters and opening their parachutes sequentially to allow each competitor a clear approach to the target This sport is unpredictable because weather conditions play a very important part So classic accuracy requires high adaptability to aerology and excellent steering control It is also the most interesting discipline for spectators due to the closeness of action a few meters and the possibility to be practiced everywhere sport ground stadium urban place Today classic accuracy is the most practiced in competition discipline of skydiving in the world Canopy formation Previously called Canopy Relative Work or CREW for short is a skydive where the participants open their parachutes very quickly after leaving the aircraft with the intention of flying in close proximity to each other The goal is to create various formations by docking with other parachutists on the jump The dock is often accomplished by placing one s feet into the lines of another person s parachute Formations require at least people but can have many more Due to the close proximity of the canopies care has to be taken by all participants to ensure the safety of the jump It is common for a CREW jumper to carry a hook knife to use in case they become entangled in another jumper s lines Formation skydiving Formation Skydiving FS was born in California USA during the s The first documented skydiving formation occurred over Arvin California in March when Mitch Poteet Don Henderson Andy Keech and Lou Paproski successfully formed a man star formation photographed by Bob Buquor This discipline was formerly referred to in the skydiving community as Relative Work often abbreviated to RW Relly or Rel Style Style can be considered as the sprint of parachuting This individual discipline is played in free fall The idea is to take maximum speed and complete a pre designated series of maneuvers as fast and cleanly as possible speed can exceed km h mph Jumps are filmed using a ground based camera with an exceptional lens to record the performance Performance is timed from the start of the manoeuvre until its completion and then judged in public at the end of the jump Competition includes qualifying rounds and a final for the top Competitors jump from a height of m to m They rush into an acceleration stage for to seconds and then run their series of manoeuvres benefiting to the maximum of the stored speed Those series consist of Turns and Back Loops to achieve in a pre designated order The incorrect performance of the manoeuvres gives rise to penalties that are added at run time The performance of the athlete is defined in seconds and hundredths of a second The competitor with the lowest cumulative time is declared the winner Notice the complete sequence is performed by leading international experts in just over seconds penalties included Tunnel flying Using a vertical wind tunnel to simulate free fall has become a discipline of its own and is not only used for training but has its own competitions teams and figures Wingsuit flying Wingsuit flying or wingsuiting is the sport of flying through the air using a wingsuit which adds surface area to the human body to enable a significant increase in lift The common type of wingsuit creates an extra surface area with fabric between the legs and under the arms Other skydiving disciplines Angle flying Angle flying was presented for the first time in at the World Freestyle Competitions the European Espace Boogie and the Eloy Freefly Festival The technique consists of flying diagonally with a determinate relation between angle and trajectory speed of the body to obtain an air stream that allows for control of flight The aim is to fly in formation at the same level and angle and to be able to perform different aerial games such as freestyle three dimensional flight formation with grip or acrobatic free flying Cross country A cross country jump is a skydive where the participants open their parachutes immediately after jumping with the intention of covering as much ground under canopy as possible The usual distance from jump run to the drop zone can be as much as several miles There are two variations of a cross country jump The more popular one is to plan the exit point upwind of the drop zone A map and information about the wind direction and velocity at different altitudes are used to determine the exit point This is usually set at a distance from where all the participants should be able to fly back to the drop zone The other variation is to jump out directly above the drop zone and fly downwind as far as possible This increases the risks of the jump substantially as the participants must be able to find a suitable landing area before they run out of altitude Two way radios and cell phones are often used to make sure everyone has landed safely and in case of a landing off the drop zone to find out where the parachutist is so that ground crew can pick them up Night jumps Parachuting is not always restricted to daytime hours experienced skydivers sometimes perform night jumps For safety reasons this requires more equipment than a usual daytime jump and in most jurisdictions it requires both an advanced skydiving license at least a B License in the U S and a meeting with the local safety official covering who will be doing what on the load A lit altimeter preferably accompanied with an audible altimeter is a must Skydivers performing night jumps often take flashlights up with them so that they can check their canopies have properly deployed Visibility to other skydivers and other aircraft is also a consideration FAA regulations require skydivers jumping at night to be wearing a light visible for three miles km in every direction and to turn it on once they are under canopy A chem light glowstick is a good idea on a night jump Night jumpers should be made aware of the dark zone when landing at night Above meters feet jumpers flying their canopy have a good view of the landing zone normally because of reflected ambient light moon light Once they get close to the ground this ambient light source is lost because of the low angle of reflection The lower they get the darker the ground looks At about feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole Suddenly it becomes very dark and the jumper hits the ground soon after This ground rush should be explained to and anticipated by the first time night jumper Recommendations should be made to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it easier to see the ground In addition in order to mitigate problems seeing the target people on the ground often park their cars with their headlights on around the target circle facing toward the center While more dangerous than regular skydiving and more difficult to schedule two night jumps are required by the USPA for a jumper to obtain their D expert license Pond swooping Pond swooping is a form of competitive parachuting wherein canopy pilots attempt to touch down and glide across a small body of water and onto the shore Events provide lighthearted competition rating accuracy speed distance and style Points and peer approval are reduced when a participant chows or fails to reach shore and sinks into the water Swoop ponds are not deep enough to drown in under ordinary circumstances their main danger being from the concussive force of an incorrectly executed maneuver In order to gain distance swoopers increase their speed by executing a hook turn wherein both speed and difficulty increase with the angle of the turn Hook turns are most commonly measured in increments of degrees As the angle of the turn increases both horizontal and vertical speed are increased such that a misjudgement of altitude or imprecise manipulation of the canopy s control structures front risers rear risers and toggles can lead to a high speed impact with the pond or Earth Prevention of injury is the main reason why a pond is used for swooping rather than a grass landing area Skysurfing Space ball This is when skydivers have a ball that weighs grams and release it in free fall The ball maintains the same fall rate as the skydivers The skydivers can pass the ball around to each other whilst in free fall At a predetermined altitude the ball master will catch the ball and hold on to it to ensure it does not impact the ground Space balls are prohibited at many drop zones due to risk to persons and property on the ground in the event that the ball is not caught or dropped during after deployment Stuff jumps Thanks to large unpopulated areas to jump over stuff jumps become possible These jumps consist of skydivers leaving the aircraft with some object Rubber raft jumps are popular where the jumpers sit in a rubber raft Cars bicycles motorcycles vacuum cleaners water tanks and inflatable companions have also been thrown out the back of an aircraft At a certain altitude the jumpers break off from the object and deploy their parachutes leaving it to smash into the ground at terminal velocity Swoop and chug A tradition at many drop zones is the swoop and chug As parachutists land from the last load of the day other skydivers often hand the landing skydivers a beer that is customarily chugged in the landing area This is sometimes timed as a friendly competition but is usually an informal untimed kick off for the night s festivities Another example of this is hit and rock a variant of accuracy landing devised to let people of varying skill levels compete for fun Hit and rock is originally from POPS Parachutists Over Phorty Society The object is to land as close as possible to the chair remove the parachute harness sprint to the chair sit fully in the chair and rock back and forth at least one time The contestant is timed from the moment that feet touch the ground until that first rock is completed This event is considered a race Tracking Tracking is where skydivers take a body position to achieve a high forward speed allowing them to cover a great distance over the ground Tracking is also used at the end of group jumps to achieve separation from other jumpers before parachute deployment The tracking position involves sweeping the arms out to the side of the body and straightening the legs with the toes pointed Arms can be positioned further back to drop altitude faster This is how a skydiver adjusts his or her elevation to match other jumpers in the formation in order to dock smoothly Sit flying This form of skydiving involves the skydivers flying in a feet to Earth position With less surface area being presented to the wind these skydivers can generate more free fall speed Head down flying This form of skydiving involves the skydivers flying in a head to Earth position Generally the object is to fly together with other skydivers and perform maneuvers during the free fall for the sheer enjoyment of it all Organizations The F d ration A ronautique Internationale FAI Parachuting Commission IPC conducts FAI s parachuting activities in particular World Records and International Competitions It sets globally recognised parachuting proficiency levels international records requirements international judging competencies and competition rules National parachuting associations exist in many countries many affiliated with the FAI to promote their sport In most cases national representative bodies as well as local drop zone operators require that participants carry certification attesting to their training their level of experience in the sport and their proven competence Anyone who cannot produce such bona fides is treated as a student requiring close supervision The sole organization in the United States is the United States Parachute Association USPA which issues licenses and ratings governs skydiving publishes Parachutist Magazine and represents skydiving to government agencies USPA publishes the Skydivers Information Manual SIM and many other resources In Canada the Canadian Sport Parachuting Association is the lead organization In South Africa the sport is managed by the Parachute Association of South Africa in France by the French Parachuting Federation and in the United Kingdom by the British Parachute Association In Brazil the Centro Nacional de Paraquedismo CNP sets in Boituva where many records have been broken and where it is known for being the second largest center in the world and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere Within the sport associations promote safety technical advances training and certification competition and other interests of their members Outside their respective communities they promote their sport to the public and often intercede with government regulators Competitions are organized at regional national and international levels in most of these disciplines Some of them offer amateur competition Many of the more photogenic videogenic variants also enjoy sponsored events with prize money for the winners The majority of jumpers tend to be non competitive enjoying the opportunity to skydive with their friends on weekends and holidays The atmosphere of their gatherings is relaxed sociable and welcoming to newcomers Skydiving events called boogies are arranged at local national and international scale each year which attracting both young jumpers and their elders Parachutists Over Phorty POPs Skydivers Over Sixty SOS and even older groups Drop zones In parachuting a drop zone or DZ is most technically the area above and around a location where a parachutist freefalls and expects to land In common use it often refers to the totality of a skydiving operation a business And the area wherein parachutists land will be referred to as the landing area The drop zone is usually situated beside a small airport often sharing the facility with other general aviation activities Drop zone staff may include the DZO drop zone operator or owner manifest pilots instructors coaches cameramen packers riggers and other general staff Equipment A parachutist s equipment consists of at least three usually four components a container harness system a main canopy a reserve canopy and frequently an automatic activation device AAD as well Other items may include a helmet goggles jumpsuit altimeter and gloves An increasing number of skydivers wear cameras like GoPros to record their skydives Costs in the sport are not trivial The market is not large enough to permit the steady lowering of prices that is seen with some other equipment like computers A new container harness system can cost between US and US main canopies for the experienced parachutist can cost between and US reserve canopies cost between US and US and AADs US cost Higher performance and tandem parachutes cost significantly more whilst large docile student parachutes often cost less Most parachuting equipment is ruggedly designed and is enjoyed by several owners before being retired A rigger is trained to spot signs of damage or misuse Riggers also keep track of industry product and safety bulletins and can therefore determine if a piece of equipment is up to date and serviceable Traveling with a parachute When traveling by plane parachutes owners may not want to put their parachute in the baggage hold in order to avoid possible deterioration due to possible incorrect handling by airport operators In such case a resulting malfunction in a future use of the parachute could be dramatic However almost all parachutes contain an automatic activation device AAD thus bringing a parachute to the plane s cabin might cause issues when going through airport security AADs can contain either void or pyrotechnic load and the rest of the parachute also consists of several very uncommon metallic parts and cables all of which could trigger scanners of the security screening In order to justify the presence of suspicious content inside the parachute explosive vacuum metal pieces cables travelers are encouraged to announce that they are traveling with a parachute when they buy their airplane ticket and to produce the following documents when asked by the airport security s staff The AAD s explanation card that shows and describes what is seen on X ray monitors Documents from a country airplane company or airport officials themselves that denote the exclusion of such devices from the forbidden items The parachute s constructor book detailing the anatomy of the whole bag Similarly to the AAD s card it can help showing the purpose of all what could raise awareness of the staff National skydiving associations usually list on their websites a piece of advice concerning this matter Record free fall parachute jumps In while doing demonstrations for the U S Army a parachute pioneer named Tiny Broadwick deployed her chute manually thus becoming the first person to jump free fall According to the Guinness Book of Records Eugene Andreev USSR holds the official FAI record for the longest free fall parachute jump after falling for metres ft from an altitude of metres ft near the city of Saratov Russia on November Although later on jumpers would ascend higher altitudes Andreev s record was set without the use of a drogue chute during the jump and therefore remains the longest genuine free fall record During the late s Captain Joseph Kittinger of the United States was assigned to the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories at Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton Ohio For Project Excelsior meaning ever upward a name given to the project by Colonel John Stapp as part of research into high altitude bailout he made a series of three parachute jumps wearing a pressurized suit from a helium balloon with an open gondola The first from feet m in November was a near tragedy when an equipment malfunction caused him to lose consciousness but the automatic parachute saved him he went into a flat spin at a rotational velocity of rpm the g force at his extremities was calculated to be over times that of gravity setting another record Three weeks later he jumped again from feet m For that return jump Kittinger was awarded the A Leo Stevens parachute medal On August he made the final jump from the Excelsior III at feet m Towing a small drogue chute for stabilization he fell for minutes and seconds reaching a maximum speed of mph km h before opening his parachute at feet m Pressurization for his right glove malfunctioned during the ascent and his right hand swelled to twice its normal size He set records for highest balloon ascent highest parachute jump longest drogue fall min and fastest speed by a human through the atmosphere The jumps were made in a rocking chair position descending on his back rather than the usual arch familiar to skydivers because he was wearing a pound kg kit on his behind and his pressure suit naturally formed that shape when inflated a shape appropriate for sitting in an airplane cockpit For the series of jumps Kittinger was decorated with an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Flying Cross and awarded the Harmon Trophy by President Dwight Eisenhower In the Red Bull Stratos mission took place On October Felix Baumgartner broke the records previously set by Kittinger for the highest free fall the highest manned helium balloon flight and the fastest free fall he jumped from feet m reaching mph km h Mach faster than the speed of sound Kittinger was a member of the mission control and helped design the capsule and suit that Baumgartner ascended and jumped in On October Alan Eustace broke the record previously set by Baumgartner for the highest fall He jumped from a height of feet m and fell with a drogue chute for minutes Other records Individual jumps Don Kellner holds the record for the most parachute jumps up to with a total of jumps He made his last eight skydives on May in Hazleton Pennsylvania before his death from cancer on the following July aged In U S Army Sergeant R W Bottriell held the world s record for the most parachute jumps with At that number Bottriell stopped parachuting and became a ground instructor Cheryl Stearns U S holds the record for the most parachute descents by a woman with a total of in August as well as the most parachute jumps made in a hour period by a woman jumps from November Erin Hogan became the world s youngest sky diver as of when she tandem jumped at age Beaten in by age Kiwi Bill Dause holds the record for the most accumulated freefall time with over hours jumps Jay Stokes holds the record for most parachute descents in a single day at The oldest female solo skydiver was Dilys Price On April she carried out the oldest solo parachute jump by a woman from Langar Airfield Nottingham UK when she was years and days The oldest female tandem skydiver is Irene O Shea She made a tandem parachute jump on December from an altitude of m ft over Adelaide Australia at the age of years Her jump raised money and awareness for the Motor Neuron Disease Association of Southern Australia The oldest male tandem skydiver according to Guinness Book of World Records is Bryson William Verdun Hayes born April who achieved the feat on May at the age of years days Bryson Hayes had earlier become the oldest ever UK sky diver achieving the feat on April when he was years old The record was previously held by Armand Gendreau born June who made a tandem parachute jump above Notre Dame de Lourdes Qu bec Canada on June at the age of years days In July year old Kenneth Meyer born February became the oldest person to skydive As of December his achievement is under review by Guinness World Records and Hayes continues to hold the Guinness record for the oldest male tandem skydiver The oldest solo United States skydiver is Milburn Hart from Seattle Washington He was years old when achieved this feat by making a solo jump in February On October after seven years of planning Felix Baumgartner Austria achieved the highest jump altitude the highest freefall and the highest speed in freefall He also became the first skydiver to break the sound barrier He started from Roswell New Mexico USA Australian stunt parachutist Captain Vincent Taylor received the unofficial record for a lowest level jump in when he jumped off a bridge over the San Francisco Bay whose center section had been raised to feet meters Group jumps World s record for the most tandem parachute jumps in a hour period is This record was set at Skydive Hibaldstow on July in memory of Stephen Sutton World s largest formation in
