selling game Gameplay Compared to the original Alan Wake which is an action adventure game with horror themes Alan Wake is a survival horror game played from a third person perspective Players play as Alan Wake or Saga Anderson in two separate single player stories which can be played in any order the player chooses although the opening and ending sequences can only be played as Saga and Alan respectively Wake and Anderson traverse environments and fight enemies using various firearms and a flashlight the latter of which can be focused to render enemies vulnerable to firearm attacks Focusing the flashlight drains its battery and players need to strategically use a limited amount of batteries and ammunition in order to survive When enemies are close Alan or Saga can perform a dodge maneuver Alan Wake incorporates detective elements when playing as Saga players can access an enemy free space dubbed the Mind Place Described by Remedy as a D menu the Mind Place is a visual representation of Saga s thoughts In the Mind Place players manage a pin board in which they can connect clues to piece together the main mystery as well as profile characters to gather clues As Alan players have access to the Writer s Room where they can see the outline of a novel he is writing By adding and changing plot details on the outline they are able to manipulate the space around Alan Both the Mind Place and the Writer s Room do not pause the outside world A returning element from Alan Wake is of finding manuscript pages that foreshadow upcoming events in the story Alan Wake features a dialogue tree system Plot The game starts with a monologue by Alan while showing him with a glowing hole in his forehead A naked man emerges from the dark shores of Cauldron Lake before he is found and ritualistically murdered FBI Special Agent Saga Anderson and her partner Alex Casey are dispatched to the town of Bright Falls to investigate a series of ritualistic murders performed by a group calling themselves the Cult of the Tree They investigate the latest victim the naked man who is revealed as former FBI agent Robert Nightingale Saga also finds a mysterious manuscript page that seems to predict the future They go to the Sheriff s station to perform an autopsy on Nightingale s corpse but it reanimates attacks them and escapes the morgue Saga chases Nightingale into an Overlap where reality and the Dark Place touch and kills him She then finds Alan Wake washed up on the shore of Cauldron Lake warning of a man named Mr Scratch who shares his face Saga and Casey take Alan back to town where he recounts how he escaped from the Dark Place After appearing in a mysterious talk show called In Between with Mr Door Alan began navigating a dark twisted version of New York City He encountered a version of Alex Casey this time as a fictional character and wrote a novel called Initiation that followed Casey s investigation of ritualistic murders in New York in mirroring events that happened in the real world Alan reunited with Thomas Zane who directed him to murder sites to continue the story He also made occasional contact with Saga through Overlaps and found video diaries from his wife Alice documenting her experiences being haunted by a man with Alan s face Alan died multiple times and repeated his journey from Mr Door s studio to a murder site to Alice s apartment again and again Eventually Alan writes Return which details the events of Saga s investigation into the Cult of the Tree but finds that it has been edited presumably by Mr Scratch into a horror story Alan warns Saga that Scratch is searching for the Clicker which amplifies the Dark Place s reality bending power and could be used to free the malevolent Dark Presence completely or permanently defeat it Saga decides to follow its trail and realizes that Return has rewritten her past so that her daughter Logan drowned in an accident Saga recovers the Clicker but before she can get it to Alan agents from the Federal Bureau of Control led by Agent Kiran Estevez arrive and apprehend him as well as the Cult leaders revealed to be town entrepreneurs Ilmo and Jaakko Koskela Saga tracks down Odin and Tor Anderson who she learns are actually her grand uncle and grandfather respectively and passed on their seer abilities to her allowing her to discern the changes to reality Return is causing Saga then heads back to Bright Falls to get the Clicker to Alan but Ilmo and Jaakko warn that he is a monster prompting Alan to kill Jaakko and attack Saga Saga reasoning that he must have been Scratch pretending to be Alan stops him with the FBC s light technology A grieving Ilmo explains that the Cult s purpose was to protect Bright Falls from the Taken people possessed by the Dark Presence that emerge from the lake Saga enlists the help of Casey Estevez Odin and Tor to summon the real Alan out of the Dark Place using the Clicker and a new song from the Old Gods of Asgard Back in the Dark Place Alan receives a phone call from his future self explaining that his repeated attempts to write himself out of the Dark Place are causing him to experience temporal loops His final journey to Alice s apartment reveals that the hauntings eventually caused her to take her own life In anger Alan kills who he believes is Scratch but is actually his past self editing Return perpetuating the loop Realizing there was no Scratch and he is responsible for Alice s death Alan s despair allows the Dark Presence to possess him The summoning ritual does bring Alan back to the real world but the time distortion sends him back earlier in the story with the Dark Presence already inside him waiting to take over After the summoning the possessed Alan attacks Saga and Saga is able to banish the Dark Presence from Alan s body only for it to possess Casey instead steal the Clicker and throw Saga into the Dark Place Alan returns to Bright Falls to find it has begun turning into a nightmarish version of his own egotistical desire for praise He finds his Writer s Room and begins writing a new ending to reverse the damage Saga with help from Mr Door implied to be her father and Alice Wake learns to navigate the Dark Place retrieving the Clicker and a Bullet of Light and reuniting with Alan to help him write an ending to save Casey and Logan With the Clicker and the revised ending Saga is able to banish the Dark Presence from Casey s body Alan goads it into possessing him again and Saga shoots him with the Bullet of Light seemingly killing him and destroying the Dark Presence As the bullet passes through Alan he sees clearly for a moment and realizes that the whole story has been looping endlessly and he will return to the beginning without his memory this monologue continues into the monologue from the game s opening As Casey recovers from his possession Saga calls Logan to see if the ending worked but the scene cuts to black while the phone rings and the credits roll In a post credits scene a recording left behind by Alice reveals she knew Alan was trapped and used her videos to trick Alan into thinking she committed suicide explaining that the only way he can escape the loops is through either destruction or ascension Alice is now in the Dark Place too helping him and Saga through the story Alan must continue the loop and keep going through destruction until he s ready for ascension with Alice s words and love as his light preparing him bit by bit Alan then revives from his gunshot wound and says It s not a loop it s a spiral The New Game Plus mode The Final Draft presents a different ending implying that the player s repeated playthroughs have brought them to the end of the spiral As he hands Saga his revised ending for Return Alan realizes that the Dark Presence was born from the darkness that was shot out of his skull by the Bullet of Light and it has been influencing him all his life The link between it and Alan was severed after he finished Return but the Dark Presence remained as Alan was missing the part of himself it was born from Alice Realizing that he and Alice are still connected through his writing and her photos the Bullet of Light finally succeeds and destroys the Dark Presence for good breaking the loop Logan answers Saga s call and Alan revives soon after no longer returning to the beginning of the loop He thanks Alice then declares himself the master of not just two worlds but many Development Pre production Remedy Entertainment released Alan Wake in Learning from Max Payne they wrote Alan Wake in a way that allows additional story to be told through sequels and further installments The team began discussing sequel ideas after Alan Wake was shipped which would continue to star Alan Wake as the protagonist but also explore the stories of the supporting characters including Wake s friend Barry Wheeler and Sheriff Sarah Breaker A prototype was created to show off the gameplay of Alan Wake when the studio was showing the game to potential publishers The game would have been a direct sequel to Alan Wake featuring new enemies and new gameplay mechanics such as being able to rewrite reality which were showcased in the prototype Ultimately Remedy pitched the project to Alan Wake publisher Microsoft Studios Microsoft however at the time was not interested in a sequel and instead tasked Remedy to create a new game This ultimately became Quantum Break released in It included alongside other easter eggs to Alan Wake a short live action film titled Alan Wake Return It features two FBI agents one named Alex Casey investigating the reappearance of Wake which had been created by Remedy as to help promote a sequel to publishers The other FBI agent was Saga Anderson who was portrayed by Malla Malmivaara She was later recast with Melanie Liburd Most of the ideas for Alan Wake were implemented in American Nightmare a downloadable follow up to Alan Wake Remedy CEO Tero Virtala stated that any further sequels to Alan Wake would require Microsoft Studios approval as the publishing rights holder though Remedy otherwise owns all other intellectual property rights to the series When Quantum Break was announced Sam Lake explained that a sequel to Alan Wake had been postponed and that Alan Wake was not financially successful enough to receive the funding they needed to continue developing the sequel at the time Director of communications Thomas Puha stated in April that Remedy had briefly returned to work on an Alan Wake property about two years prior but the effort did not work out and the company was booked for the next few years between their own new game Control supporting Smilegate on its game CrossfireX and another new project Puha said that the only limited factor for them to work on an Alan Wake sequel was time money and resources Despite that Lake continued to be part of a team in Remedy to brainstorm ideas and work on different incarnations for Alan Wake Internally the project was code named Project Big Fish which represented its importance and significance to Remedy In the second downloadable content pack for Control Remedy s next game following Quantum Break Alan Wake was featured as a character According to Remedy Control established the Remedy Connected Universe which is shared by both Control and Alan Wake and that the next game released by the studio will also be set on this universe Remedy fully acquired the rights to Alan Wake from Microsoft in July including a one time royalty payment of about million for the game series past sales which helped pave the way for a sequel Remedy had signed with Epic Games Publishing in for the release of two games Remedy released Alan Wake Remastered in October as the first game of this partnership while the second larger game Alan Wake was announced at The Game Awards Remedy s communications director Thomas Puha said that Epic allowed Remedy to create the game they wanted to make with minimal publisher interference while providing extensive feedback to help improve the game Production With Epic as their publisher Remedy began production on Alan Wake in August According to Sam Lake the game would be powered by Remedy s own Northlight Engine which they used for Quantum Break and Control Lake also stated that Alan Wake would be a survival horror game as opposed to Alan Wake which Lake said was an action game with horror elements though he did not explain the difference between the two Lake further added that players will not need to play the previous games in order to understand Alan Wake The sequel continued to draw inspiration from the works of David Lynch particularly Twin Peaks while also bringing more detective themes from works like Seven The Silence of the Lambs and True Detective Lake said that his approach to Alan Wake was bolstered by the success of the film Everything Everywhere All At Once Remedy confirmed the game would remain in the third person perspective despite the switch to survival horror and that both Ilkka Villi and Matthew Porretta would return to provide the appearance and the voice of Alan respectively Other cast include Melanie Liburd as the live action and voice of Saga Anderson David Harewood as both the live action and voice of Mr Door James McCaffrey and Lake as the voice and live action appearance of Alex Casey respectively Further Alan Wake includes cameos from characters in Control including Jesse Faden voiced by Courtney Hope Dr Darling Porretta and the mysterious janitor Ahti Martti Suosalo Alan s story includes a mission known as Initiation or We Sing which has the player guide Alan through a surreal set while Alan s psyche Mr Door and others sing Herald of Darkness a musical via live action video summarizing Alan s story to that point with music provided by Poets of the Fall playing as the fictional band The Old Gods of Asgard Lake said the idea for the musical sequence was inspired by Alan Wake s concert standoff as well as the Ashtray Maze level in Control both set to Poets of the Fall s music Lake also knew that Porretta Wake and Harewood Mr Door could sing and Poets of the Fall were able to help with choreography Frequently through development some of the developers questioned the need for the musical sequence due to both the strangeness of the sequence in the horror game and the difficulties in pulling it off However Lake insisted that the sequence be kept The song was played live at The Game Awards by Poets of the Fall along with Villi Porretta Harewood and Lake reprising their roles Overall the game took years to develop In an interview Sam Lake said this was because The sequel contains many characters and locations as well as a continuation of the supernatural lore established and introduced in the original Alan Wake The Budget for the game reportedly stands at million with million in development and an additional million spent on marketing This is considered to make the game one of the most expensive cultural products in the history of Finland Graphics technology Prior to the release of Alan Wake Remedy Entertainment had earned a reputation for pushing visual boundaries and graphics technology with releases such as Control and Max Payne Alan Wake was developed with ninth generation consoles in mind For its traditional graphics rasterization Alan Wake harnesses mesh shaders that are only supported by the PlayStation Xbox Series X S and Nvidia GeForce RTX series or AMD Radeon RX series GPUs and later on PC The game was the first to be released with native support for mesh shaders As opposed to older vertex and geometry shading techniques mesh shaders try to reduce the bottleneck from rendering a large number of fixed vertex triangles by instead flexibly rendering large groups of triangles Developers are given greater control over rendering complex geometry as mesh shaders can be segmented into smaller meshlets that can be re used and rendered in parrallel while making less calls for data from memory The graphics pipeline is also shorter with mesh shaders as opposed to a traditional vertex and tessellation pipeline Alan Wake running on hardware without mesh shaders support such as the Nvidia GeForce GTX series or AMD Radeon RX series GPUs results in poor performance and visual errors Ray tracing is extensively used in Alan Wake to better simulate how light reacts realistically behaves in the real world Scenes are lit using global illumination and the light provided by the global light source bounces off surfaces and diffuses depending on the materials present The use of ray tracing is particularly important for adding ambience to dark scenes in the game that feature flashlights as a sole light source Alan Wake even goes beyond ray tracing to incorporate path tracing where diffused light will also bounce across duller surfaces in addition to reflective ones Path tracing s computational demands means that it is not not available on the limited console hardware Alan Wake s extensive use of ray tracing made it a promotional vessel for Nvidia s graphics technologies such as supporting DLSS Ray Reconstruction On Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards it seeks to improve ray tracing visual quality and performance by not performing calculations on multiple rays per pixel and instead using machine learning to fill in the gaps Music The original score for Alan Wake by Finnish composer Petri Alanko was released via Epic Games and Laced Records on May the th anniversary of the first Alan Wake game s release Alanko returns to the role of composer from the first Alan Wake game with his approach to composing for Alan Wake akin to reuniting with an old friend discovering both familiar and new elements to play with Alanko first began recording Alan Wake s original score in and in the years since then it became a very different entity The biggest change that occurred since Alanko began work on the score was the addition of the game s second protagonist Saga Anderson In the years since beginning work on Alan Wake s score he also composed the score for Remedy Entertainment s game Control To create some of the sounds for Alan Wake Alanko used unconventional means such as dropping pianos off forklift trucks Release Remedy announced in May that Alan Wake would be a digital only release rationalizing that many players had already shifted to only buying games digitally so they wanted to ensure the game maintains a low price and they didn t want it to require a separate download even if a physical version was released Originally planned to release for PlayStation Windows and Xbox Series X S on October Remedy delayed the game by ten days to October to avoid competition from other major triple A releases The PC version is exclusive to the Epic Games Store for a long time Free downloadable content packs and two paid expansions titled Night Springs and Lake House will be released after the game s initial launch Remedy later reversed their decision and announced that physical editions of the game would release in late Marketing An Alan Wake cosmetic outfit was added to Fortnite Battle Royale as part of the Fortnitemares event and a retelling of the first Alan Wake was available within Fortnite Creative in the weeks prior to the sequel s release to help new players come up to speed on events from the first game From October to November a free copy of Alan Wake was included in a promotional bundle with the purchase of certain Nvidia GeForce RTX series GPUs The eligible GPUs for the bundle were the RTX RTX Ti RTX and RTX Alan Wake was added to the video game Dead by Daylight in January Additional cosmetics were included with his release including skins that turn the character into either Saga Anderson Rose Marigold and Mr Scratch Downloadable content The first piece of downloadable content Night Springs was released on June It contains three episodes featuring echoes of existing characters in the Remedy shared universe in what if type scenarios within Bright Falls These include Number One Fan with the player controlling Rose the waitress the second is the Actor who is based on real life actor Shawn Ashmore appearing as a character named Shawn Ashmore as well as Sherriff Tim Breaker whom Ashmore also voices the third is the Sibling which features Jesse Faden the main character of Control The second expansion The Lake House is planned for October Reception Alan Wake received generally favorable reviews from critics for the PC and PS versions while the Xbox Series X version received universal acclaim according to review aggregator website Metacritic Andrew Farrell of PCGamesN in his Alan Wake review awarded the game out of saying Alan Wake is a
