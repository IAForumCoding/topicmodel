discuss his game A Way Out Fares who had a prior history in the film industry before starting video game development started his rant by saying Fuck the Oscars before speaking about how the Game Awards ceremony helped to highlight the developers and personalities that were passionate about their work He also spoke a bit to the then recent situation around loot boxes and microtransactions related to Electronic Arts game Star Wars Battlefront II as Electronic Arts is also the publisher for A Way Out Fares stated that while It s nice to hate EA that All publishers fuck up sometimes you know while expressing his appreciate for their support for his game Fares said in a later interview that he was caught up in the moment but still believed in the general points he had been trying to make specifically Fares indicated that video games as a medium was still seen in its infancy by most other media sources and that the Game Awards was treating the industry with the proper respect Viewership Keighley reported that around million viewers watched the show tripling the million viewers from The Game Awards Keighley believed part of this was their approach to gamify the show with the interactive winner predictions on their Twitch and Steam broadcasts which also helped to increase the average length of time viewers watched from about minutes the previous year to minutes in Keighley also attributes the higher viewership due to the quality of games that were released in and nominated and the anticipation for yet seen game trailers and new game announcements though he wants to avoid future shows from being more like E Game announcements In addition to trailers and presentations for upcoming games and content for current ones a short teaser for a game by FromSoftware was also shown later revealed to be Sekiro Shadows Die Twice The show also included trailers from two films Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle and The Shape of Water The list of games that were featured included Awards The nominees were announced on November In order to be eligible candidate games must have had either a commercial or early access release date on or before November The list of nominees were selected by a panel of people in the video game industry with the top five games or six in the case of ties selected in each category presented as nominees Public voting for
