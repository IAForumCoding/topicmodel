originally developed under the name World of Wonders In the team scrapped its existing work and restarted development which resulted in Age of Wonders The game won positive reviews and was a moderate commercial success with global sales of roughly units by It began a franchise and was followed by five sequels Age of Wonders II The Wizard s Throne Age of Wonders Shadow Magic Age of Wonders III Age of Wonders Planetfall and Age of Wonders In the first game was re released on GOG com and Steam Gameplay Age of Wonders is a turn based strategy game that takes place from an isometric perspective which consists of hexagonal tiles Units are arranged into groups also known as parties or stacks of up to eight units a single such group occupies one tile Cities occupy between one and four tiles and other structures generally occupy a single tile Units within the game have a limited number of movement points which are replenished at the beginning of each turn Two turn systems are used sequential or classic where players take their turns in order or simultaneous where all players can move units at once In practice actions in the latter system are added and executed via a queue The game has a single player campaign playable from two sides more campaigns have been made by the community since release and many maps both included and user created that can be played in Hotseat mode over a LAN on the Internet or by email PBEM Up to players can participate in a single game depending on the map Simultaneous turns are only available in single player and live multiplayer games PBEM and hotseat games and all combat use the sequential turn system Each player leads a certain race There are races available in the game though not all of them may be present on every map and of those which are not all may be playable List of races includes traditional fantasy Elves Lizardmen Humans Goblins Dark Elves Undead Orcs Dwarves and Halflings as well as several unique ones such as Frostlings Azracs and Highmen Races as well as units not belonging to any specific race such as dragons and giants have a certain alignment which can be good neutral or evil According to their alignment and certain other factors cities and independent units of one race can be friendly or hostile towards another race This can manifest itself in different ways for example an orc city is not likely to surrender to the elves and if conquered may revolt unless there is a strong military presence in it to oppress the population Units of hostile races forced to fight alongside each other in a single group will have lower morale and are more likely to desert Race relations can be improved by acts of goodwill towards other races such as upgrading their cities or hampered by razing looting or migrating cities belonging to that race Diplomacy can also affect this and even an alliance with one race might affect the relation of another race There are also several spells which have a global effect on race relations There are two resources gold and mana Gold is used to build units buy heroes cities and spells in Wizard Towers upgrade cities Mana is used to cast and research spells and use altars Units can be built in cities which can be further upgraded to produce more advanced units Also wandering independent not belonging to any player groups of units can be hired if they are well disposed towards the player Units may have different strength reflected by their level which can vary from to Units under player control require a certain amount of gold every turn as an upkeep the size of which depends upon the level of the unit Summoned units use mana for upkeep instead of gold Units earn experience for killing other units The amount of experience earned depends on the number of enemy units killed as well as their level the level of the enemy killed is the amount of experience gained Upon earning a certain amount of experience the unit gets a silver medal and later on a gold one Higher level units require more experience to earn medals Units with medals also get slight increases to their basic parameters or otherwise improve their combat performance A special type of unit a hero can only be hired when they appear at random at one of the player s cities Heroes earn experience points just like all other units do however instead of getting medals for it they gain levels to a maximum of level Upon reaching the next level they get a number of skill points which a player can then spend to improve their parameters and teach them special abilities This point system is similar to that used in many role playing video games In addition to that heroes are the only units in the game which can learn the Spell Casting special ability allowing them to cast spells The Spell Casting special ability can be upgraded from level I to level V Each level provides more mana income research points and also improves the channeling points allowing the hero to cast more better spells each turn Some spells require many turns to cast even with level V Spell Casting Heroes can not work together to cast one spell each must cast it individually Unlike common units heroes can be brought from dead by magical means although such experience will greatly decrease their morale Scattered across the board are a series of structures known as altars These altars harness different types of magic and can be used as large scale weapons To fire off an altar a player must first take control of it then target a spot on the board within a certain range then click to cast the spell over the targeted area Altars require mana to fire Each turn they accumulate mana charge requiring turns to fully recharge Players with enough mana crystals may fire an altar multiple times sequentially without recharging Spells are divided into three types unit spells which enhance a single unit combat spells which are used to directly damage or handicap the enemy during combat and global spells which can affect terrain structures and groups of units on the global map or summon magical creatures to player s aid All have different mana costs depending on how advanced they are and some of the more powerful unit and global spells can take more than one turn to cast Counterspells to block and dispel unit and global enchantments are also available Each spell furthermore belongs to one of the eight spheres of magic Life Death Air Earth Fire Water Cosmos and Secret Chaos Mana the magical energy required to research and cast spells is channeled from magic nodes Some of those are generic and provide equal though small amount to caster of any sphere Others are linked to one of the elemental planes and only channel a specific kind of energy thus a Fire node for example can only be used by a player who chose the Fire sphere Heroes with Spell Casting also generate mana your King Leader more so than others Combat Combat is initiated by one player attempting to move a stack onto a hex occupied by another player If the players are at war the attacker has the option of selecting tactical combat where the players move individual units on a small map representing the battlefield or automatic fast combat where the computer determines how the battle would have taken place by weighing off each side s attack defense and movement parameters Tactical combat is only available on single player maps against independent units in PBEM games and optionally against human players in live multiplayer games Both forms of combat use the sequential turn system Spells may be cast during combat though global spells are disabled Combat spells may target a unit or a group of units of the enemy collectively damaging or temporarily handicapping them Handicaps are usually introduced alongside direct damage and vary from short term paralysis to poisoning or a curse Most spells have a maximum range All ranged attacks including some types of spells and some melee strikes can result in friendly fire For example an archer firing an arrow at a target can hit and injure a friendly unit if it is on the line of fire Trees buildings and other obstacles scattered around combat maps also hamper ranged attacks as well as movement to various degrees and can be used to one s advantage to great effect Unit parameters and special abilities play a heavy role in combat Attack is matched against target s defence to determine whether a hit was scored and then damage determined the number of hit points the target loses Some offensive spells have to beat the target s resistance instead or even both defence and resistance Physical attacks such as archery target defence while other attacks such as venomous spit target resistance Equal values of the attacker and the defender parameters results in a chance to hit and for each point of difference this is changed by but to a minimum of or a maximum of While most commonly only physical damage is dealt sometimes attacks are partially or fully magical in nature and can result in additional negative effects on the target a fire strike has a chance of setting the target aflame a lightning strike can paralyse the target and so on At the same time units often have protection and or immunity against specific forms of attacks Protection reduces the damage of that effect by e g lightning bolts with marksmanship II a skill to improve attack damage of a ranged attack has attack damage but would do a maximum of damage against a unit with lightning protection and none against a unit with lightning immunity Development Age of Wonders underwent a long development cycle CNET Gamecenter s Mark Asher joked that it had been in development ever since programming a computer was a matter of punching holes in cards It was originally developed under the name World of Wonders for MS DOS and was later upgraded for Windows The team ultimately scrapped this version of the game in leading to the final released version of Age of Wonders The game originally incorporated several role playing video game elements that were dropped when simultaneous turns were implemented The music files within Age of Wonders are in Impulse Tracker IT format and were composed by Michiel van den Bos who has also composed for other notable titles such as Deus Ex and the Unreal series of games There are tunes in the main gameplay and also other tunes to accompany different situations within gameplay The st tune called In The Company of Elves was included with the demo version of Age of Wonders but not with the final release of the game In the demo version all songs beside the title song were in the Scream Tracker s m format Reception The game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings IGN reviewer Jason Bates wrote if you are at all interested in turn based strategy games with a fantasy theme go get this game Bates praised many of the game s features including the graphics gameplay mechanics editor and online connectivity but said the music was uninspiring and called the sound effects serviceable but bland AllGame s Nick Woods wrote If you love strategy and role playing games Age of Wonders is worth the purchase giving it three and a half stars out of five However GameZone s Jason Lambert gave it out of writing Small flaws and annoyances made this game a little less than expected If you are wanting to play something different than the Heroes of Might and Magic Warlords or the new Disciples then you may want to try this game If you are happy with what you are currently playing then save your money and buy your mom a Christmas present Greg Vederman of NextGen wrote that Age of Wonders stands tall as one of the best games of the year Domestically the game sold copies by April and totaled copies by October Its global sales had reached roughly units by March At the time PC Player noted that Age of Wonders was not necessarily one of the biggest sellers in gaming history but that its commercial performance was adequate to justify a sequel PC Gamer US and CNET Gamecenter nominated the game for their Best Turn Based Strategy Game awards both of which ultimately went to Sid Meier s Alpha Centauri The staff wrote that the former game took the tired fantasy based theme we ve seen time and again and breathed new life into it Legacy Age of Wonders began the Age of Wonders series It was followed by five sequels Age of Wonders II The Wizard s Throne Age of Wonders Shadow Magic Age of Wonders III Age of Wonders Planetfall and Age of Wonders Modding The Age of Wonders came with a basic map editing utility AoWEd that allows players to create their own scenarios or to edit existing scenarios included in the game Scenario makers also referred to as mapmakers were able to draw maps with rich stories from their own imaginations or took inspiration from classic fantasy worlds such as that of Tolkien Dungeons Dragons etc Many of such carefully crafted scenarios have been touted as being of higher quality than that which came with the game Having scenario makers actively utilising the AoWEd to make new scenarios meant that players were almost never in short supply of new maps to try out and enjoy Custom made scenarios were also often used in multiplayer PBEM tournaments Thus the AoWEd was largely responsible for keeping the fans of the game entertained until the release of the sequel Age of Wonders The AoWEd was also used to generate the maps for the free online multiplayer game Battlemaster The first mod released was known as Warlock s Ruleset after the player who created it The mod changed some in game costs and added new units and structures Since the accidental release of the developer s editor known as DevEd many more mods have been made by the fan community notably at HeavenGames including the very popular Lighthawk s Rules However there are some aspects of the game that can only be changed by use of a hex editor References External links
