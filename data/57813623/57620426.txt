from publishers and sponsors Concepts were being considered by August including the involvement of Hans Zimmer who was originally involved in the previous show but dropped out due to other commitments Keighley began to book presenters in October having secured developers such as Josef Fares and Jeff Kaplan by mid month he spoke to Peter Jackson about a collaboration but it fell through For the ceremony the production team focused on stage lighting for immersion Once the team approved Bennett s designs in September they turned to the budgeting phase where ideas were often cut In late October eleven members of the production team moved into a four building office complex in Santa Monica transitioning from virtual meetings hundreds of people ultimately contributed to the production by December Keighley estimated he worked on the show for around hours each day from August to November and hours for the final month Kim felt she had a yin and yang dynamic with Keighley She worried he would spend too much time concerned about minute details Keighley agreed noting he enjoyed the work and does not regret it but wanted to employ more people in future to shift his focus Kim aimed for the show to be around or percent completed before Thanksgiving in November when the team took a week off To maintain secrecy a security crew supervised rehearsals Keighley kept secrets from his team and senior production members only learned of some announcements in the days before the show trailers were only listed under code names with expected durations Keighley wrote most of his own scripts

show s inception in as he felt it was a metaphor for bringing the industry together While all three leaders personally agreed to the speech it took several months of negotiations before confirmation Keighley felt it had fallen apart in the days before the show but magically it came back together in time The Game Awards Orchestra opened the show with its new theme song an original composition by its conductor Lorne Balfe who had worked with Keighley on the Spike Video Game Awards He wrote the piece to represent Keighley s work and the general gaming community Balfe suggested Zimmer and Harry Gregson Williams perform alongside Celeste composer Lena Raine and Anthem composer Sarah Schachner to illustrate the industries of film television and video games combined Schachner worried how Anthem s score would translate to an orchestral performance but after arranging a shortened version of the game s theme found it started falling into place For the Game of the Year medley Balfe was forced to
