Harmonix Music Systems Inc doing business as Harmonix is an American video game developer company based in Boston Massachusetts The company was established in May by Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy Harmonix is perhaps best known as being the developer of music video games series Dance Central and Rock Band as well as being the original developer and creator of the Guitar Hero series before development moved to Neversoft and Vicarious Visions History Formation Harmonix was founded on May by Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy who met while attending MIT Egozy was an electrical computer engineer with an interest in music while Rigopulos was a music composition major with an interest in programming both met while working in the MIT Media Lab After building a computer music generation system that could algorithmically create music on the fly the two considered how one could use a joystick to control the system and set up a demonstration of the unit for the Lab which gained interest from others in the Lab The two realized that after graduation that they probably couldn t pursue such ideas working at any existing companies so they chose to start their own The company was built on the premise that the experience of performing music could become accessible to those who would otherwise have trouble learning a traditional instrument The company was initially funded with about US and for the first five years had nearly zero revenue The company s earliest product was The Axe on PC CD ROM The Axe enabled consumers to easily perform unique instrumental solos by using a PC joystick This product only sold about copies with Rigopulos and Egozy realizing that people while initially entranced by the game lost interest after minutes of playing with it Harmonix then designed CamJam which performed similar functions this time using simple body gestures to trigger music sequences CamJam was utilized at Disney theme parks This led the two to consider approaching entertainment businesses like Dave Buster s to include their products but they soon realized that this would be a year to a year and a half effort too long for their needs They then considered the entertainment industry in Japan where in was taking off with the introduction of karaoke bars and music video games such as PaRappa the Rapper Beatmania and Dance Dance Revolution They attempted to sell their CamJam equipment to these entertainment centers but found little interest for it They came to a realization that games like karaoke were popular not due to personal expression but because they encouraged players to try to accurately recreate the songs through their actions These games also focused on bringing musical experiences to gamers through simple understandable interfaces commonly found in games With this realization the two returned to the United States and regrouped their company as a video game developer though they had to let about of their current staff go Early titles Harmonix first major video game was Frequency with its development funded by Sony Computer Entertainment along with about million in investments in the company A key factor of Harmonix contract with Sony was that it was allowed to keep its intellectual property which allowed for Harmonix to build on the game for its future endeavours The game s development began in backed by a larger team at Harmonix many of whom were musicians Featuring songs by a number of underground electronica artists FreQuency allowed players to perform and remix a variety of music The game was backed by SCEA Vice President of Product Development Shuhei Yoshida Released in on the PlayStation FreQuency was critically acclaimed and won numerous awards though it failed to become a mainstream success Harmonix developed a sequel Amplitude released in Several changes were made from its predecessor to broaden the game s appeal from gameplay tweaks to a more mainstream soundtrack And again Amplitude achieved awards critical praise and a small cult following but it was not a financial hit The two attributed the poor response to the games due in part to the lack of a mainstream soundtrack and that the gameplay was difficult to connect to if one was not playing the game After Amplitude Harmonix was approached by Konami to create the Karaoke Revolution franchise Konami known for their Bemani line of music games wanted to distribute their games in the United States and Harmonix was the only music game developer in the country at the time Konami was responsible for publishing the Karaoke Revolution titles of which Harmonix developed and released three volumes between and The series was much more successful due to its mainstream music and its marketability Also in Sony Computer Entertainment released the Harmonix project EyeToy AntiGrav A departure from music games the title used the PlayStation EyeToy camera peripheral to enable one s body to perform as a controller for a futuristic extreme sports game However the game was poorly received by critics despite selling four times as many copies as FreQuency or Amplitude These results left Rigopulos and Egozy depressed about the prospects for music games At this time RedOctane a peripheral manufacturing company who had enjoyed Harmonix previous games approached Harmonix about developing the software for a game that would be based on a guitar shaped controller inspired by GuitarFreaks which was popular in Japan This relationship led to the creation of Guitar Hero published by RedOctane in The game features similar gameplay elements to FreQuency and Amplitude Guitar Hero uses a guitar shaped controller designed uniquely for the game Specifically the Guitar Hero controller was designed with five color coded fret buttons and a strum bar Guitar Hero became largely successful both critically and commercially resulting in the well received sequel Guitar Hero II also developed by Harmonix Purchase by Viacom In the early part of Activision acquired RedOctane and several publishers became interested in acquiring Harmonix In September MTV Networks a division of media conglomerate Viacom announced that it was acquiring Harmonix on behalf of MTV Networks for million Harmonix s last Guitar Hero game for RedOctane Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the s was released in July thus fulfilling their contractual obligations with the publisher Before they left the series Harmonix had already envisioned expanding the gameplay of Guitar Hero to multiple instruments a concept that would eventually lead to Rock Band that would develop under MTV Shortly after the acquisition by MTV in December the initial discussion between Dhani Harrison son of George Harrison and MTV President Van Toffler occurred that would eventually lead to meetings between Harmonix and Apple Corps Ltd leading to the creation of The Beatles Rock Band though this was not publicly revealed until late Harmonix released Rock Band in November As Harmonix s first game as a part of MTV Rock Band expanded upon the design of Guitar Hero by incorporating three different peripherals guitar bass microphone and drums Harmonix continued to support the game after its initial release by offering a variety of downloadable songs to PlayStation and Xbox players on a weekly basis As of March over songs have been made available as downloadable content with over million songs downloaded In October Harmonix along with MTV Games announced an exclusive agreement with Apple Corps Ltd to produce a standalone title based on the Rock Band premise and featuring the music of The Beatles to be released late in The Beatles Rock Band features a visual and musical history of the Beatles and includes songs from their tenure with EMI using United Kingdom released versions of their albums Please Please Me through Abbey Road The developers have worked with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr to gain input on the game and were using Giles Martin son of Sir George Martin who produced most of the Beatles albums as music director for the game Harmonix stated despite building on the Rock Band gameplay this would not be a Rock Band branded title and that the songs would not be available as downloadable content for the Rock Band series The agreement had been in discussion for more than months before the announcement In November Viacom paid Harmonix a million bonus as part of the terms of the company s acquisition The previous quarter s bonus was million In a survey of the best places to work in the Boston area the Boston Globe ranked Harmonix as the rd best workplace overall and the top mid size business in its poll On December Harmonix laid off of its employees primarily in the QA department Sale by Viacom On November Viacom stated that it was in talks with potential buyers for Harmonix having already marked the unit as a discontinued operation to write off a million loss for its third quarter earnings statement Such talks had been in place since September before the release of either Rock Band or Dance Central Viacom president and CEO Philippe Dauman stated the reason they were selling the company was to refocus Viacom as an entertainment creator and that the console games business requires expertise Viacom doesn t have Viacom also recognized that without dedicated resources to support video game development the company was not able to take advantage of efficiencies the dedicated video game publishers have Martin Peers of the Wall Street Journal noted that Viacom lacked the physical distribution channels that other entertainment companies like Time Warner have and instead were forced to rely on Electronic Arts to distribute the game and cut into their potential profits Industry analyst Michael Pachter suggested that while Rock Band and Dance Central would generate significant revenue in holiday sales Viacom likely made the move to sell Harmonix while the developers were doing well and in the news Electronic Arts CEO John Riccitiello commenting on the potential purchase of Harmonix by his company called Harmonix a falling knife in regards to the diminishing size of the rhythm game market since and stated that more people have been cut trying to catch falling knives than have benefited from getting the timing exactly right John Drake of Harmonix affirmed that Viacom would continue to support Harmonix until the sale is complete and the developer would still continue their normal operations for their games which is unaffected by the sale In late December Viacom announced that it had sold Harmonix to Harmonix SBE Holdings LLC a holding company for the family office of investor Jason Epstein Epstein is a senior managing partner at investment firm Columbus Nova though the buy out of Harmonix was conducted by Epstein personally and not Columbus Nova The terms of the sale were undisclosed though estimated at million This sale returned Harmonix to its origins as an independent developer The resulting sale did not affect present or future support plans for Harmonix games Harmonix retained the intellectual property rights for Rock Band and Dance Central in the sale allowing Harmonix Music Systems to continue to develop these series According to Peter Kafka of the Wall Street Journal the sale of Harmonix was heavily discounted possibly as low as fifty dollars the equivalent of a fire sale and allowing Viacom to claim certain tax benefits meanwhile the new independent owners would assume all ongoing liability for Harmonix projects including music licensing fees and unsold inventory Viacom later affirmed that they received nearly million in tax benefits from the Harmonix sale Following the purchase Harmonix underwent a restructuring in February laying off about of the person staff Shortly after this Activision announced it was shuttering its Guitar Hero division and cancelling planned games for which many journalists considered to mark the end of the rhythm game genre Harmonix s Director of Communications John Drake in response to this closure called the news discouraging but affirmed that Harmonix would continue to invest itself in further Rock Band and Dance Central developments for the foreseeable future While Viacom sought a buyer for Harmonix shareholders of Harmonix including founders Rigopulos and Egozy filed a lawsuit against Viacom alleging misconduct in providing performance payouts in line with the terms of the purchase of Harmonix by Viacom Harmonix suit contests that while Viacom had paid Harmonix million for success of the Rock Band series in the shareholders are due a substantially larger sum for continued success in as determined by their proxy Walter Winshall Viacom countered the claims stating that Winshall rejected various offers made by Viacom for the payout The lawsuit also contends that Viacom has withheld million in payouts from which Viacom had claimed at the time were to cover potential losses in patent lawsuits that were initiated against Harmonix by Activision and Gibson which have since been settled out of court Viacom has stated it would vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit and initiated a counter suit in September suing Harmonix for million believing the million payout was overcalculated In late BDO USA the contract assigned arbitrator on the matter concluded that Viacom owed million to Harmonix in addition to the money already paid out a total of million when combined with the initial purchase by Viacom and initial million advance payment in Viacom disputed this figure claiming that BDO s report excluded specific evidence supplied by Viacom Of the million owed to Harmonix Viacom agreed to pay million in part to settle the payments leaving the dispute for the payments in court In August the Delaware Court of Chancery dismissed Viacom s claims and ordered the company to pay Harmonix the remaining million though Viacom stated that it was seeking what further options it had Viacom appealed the decision but the previous judgement was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in July As an independent developer Approximately to months after its sale from Viacom Harmonix started to grow again boosted by sales of Dance Central which led to the development of its sequel Dance Central in late By mid the company began developing new IP in both the mobile and social game markets and began rehiring to aid in the development of these games Continued support of the Rock Band franchise has remained a meaningful source of profitability to Harmonix through according to Rigopulos Bloomberg then projected that Harmonix would post million in profit in based on sales of Dance Central and continued downloadable content for the game At the onset of the E conference
