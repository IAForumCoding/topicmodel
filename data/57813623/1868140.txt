Similar to its predecessors Unreal Tournament is primarily an online multiplayer title There are eight modes including Deathmatch Capture the Flag as well as modes like Duel Warfare Betrayal and Greed In vehicle maps the player is equipped with a hover board which allows players to quickly traverse large maps and grapple onto other teammates vehicles The game s single player campaign does not follow a plot based around the eponymous tournament but rather a Necris attack that occurs on a colony on an unknown planet releasing armed Kralls a warlike race of aliens on the humans The game received positive reviews from critics and sold more than million copies worldwide Gameplay Similar to the prior entries of the series the game is primarily an online multiplayer title offering several game modes including large scale Warfare Capture the Flag and Deathmatch It also includes an extensive offline multiplayer game with an in depth story beginning with a simple tournament ladder and including team members with unique personalities The following game modes are included Deathmatch Team Deathmatch Capture the Flag Duel a one versus one game mode It uses a queuing system the winner stays and the loser goes back to the end of the queue A typical match lasts fifteen minutes with the winner being the player with the most kills Warfare a mix of Onslaught and Assault game modes While basic game rules are equal to those of Onslaught Warfare adds countdown nodes which after being captured and defended for a certain period of time create a vehicle or trigger an event helpful to the capturing team as well as the orb which can be used to instantly capture and defend nodes Vehicle Capture the Flag Capture the Flag with vehicles as part of the map this game mode is distinct from the standard Capture the Flag mode Also players are given a hoverboard rather than a translocator Betrayal this game type places freelance players on teams and when the members of each team kill enemies the pot for that team grows Anybody on a team with a pot can betray the rest of the team by shooting them thus taking the pot but they must defend themselves from the betrayed teammates for seconds after that or the teammates receive extra points Greed a game mode that like the UT mod of the same name focuses on collecting skulls dropped from dead players and capturing them in the opposing team s base For Greed the game uses all Capture the Flag and Vehicle Capture the Flag maps Modes not returning from the prior Unreal Tournament games include Invasion Mutant having been later on partially replaced by the Titan mutator in the UT Titan Pack Onslaught replaced by Warfare Bombing Run Last Man Standing Domination and Double Domination Assault was removed from the game during production In this installment of Unreal Tournament the vehicles are split into two factions the Axon vehicles and Necris vehicles The Axon vehicles are the same vehicles from Unreal Tournament but several have significant game play changes In addition on vehicle maps every player is equipped with a personal hover board a skateboard like device that allows players to quickly traverse large maps and grapple onto other teammates vehicles The hover board is vulnerable to attack and any hit will knock the player off the board and disable him or her for several seconds leaving the player exposed and vulnerable The player cannot use any weapons while on the board Plot Unlike the prior Unreal Tournament games the single player campaign does not follow a plot based around the Tournament Grand Championship and therefore several of the teams within Unreal Tournament are not Tournament competitors The five playable factions are the Iron Guard a team of human mercenaries affiliated with the Axon the Ronin a band of four survivors of a Skaarj attack on a human colony Liandri studius a series of advanced humanoid robots custom built or retrofitted for combat the Krall a warlike race of aliens formerly under the leadership of the Skaarj returning from their initial appearance in the original Unreal and the Necris warriors who have undergone the process of the same name making them stronger at the expense of replacing their biological processes with Nanoblack effectively turning them into undead soldiers hence the name Necris In the Campaign players control members of the Ronin and the Necris serve as the chief antagonists In the game s story a Necris attack occurs on the Twin Souls colony of Taryd an Earth like planet releasing bloodthirsty reptilian Krall on the humans The colony is defenseless but a group of soldiers called Ronin arrive on the scene defending the survivors Reaper the group s leader is caught in the explosion of an incoming rocket and passes out but not before seeing an unknown Necris woman revealed to be Necris High Inquisitor Akasha executing a wounded soldier next to him Reaper is rescued by Othello and Jester and wakes up in the base of the Izanagi a megacorporation with a large private army and meets with their leader Malcolm a celebrated former tournament champion Malcolm promises Reaper and the rest of Ronin that if they join the Izanagi they will take the fight to the Necris and avenge the massacre of Twin Souls The missions of the campaign are identical to multiplayer matches with the only difference being the enemies are computer controlled bots instead of human players The Izanagi pits Ronin against the Axon in a campaign to seize their vehicle technology and then begins a campaign against the Liandri to seize their rich Tarydium mines both of which are required for sustaining a war against the Necris Shortly after this the Necris launch a surprise invasion of Taryd destroying cities and massacring civilians The Necris are seen deploying tentacle like tubes carrying Nanoblack into the planet s surface from orbit in order to terraform the entire world The Izanagi then mount a counterattack and Ronin is sent on several missions to push the Necris back After successfully repelling the Necris assault and ending the invasion Reaper and the rest of Ronin decide to break ranks and pursue the Necris to their homeworld Omicron in an effort to kill Akasha for good Finally cornering Akasha in her last sanctuary on Omicron Reaper defeats her in a duel and kills her with his rocket launcher However it is revealed that Malcolm has betrayed Ronin allowing Necris troops to surround and kill Jester Bishop and Othello Reaper swears revenge on Malcolm before powering up his rocket launcher and leaping to attack the Necris Development and release The game was announced in May as Unreal Tournament for a release but the game was delayed until the first half of The game was
