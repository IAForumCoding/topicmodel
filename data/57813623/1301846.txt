with a troubled development history at D Realms who had created the Duke Nukem series since sometime prior to Due to financial difficulties in D Realms was forced to downsize and ultimately lay off most of the development staff Take Two Interactive sued D Realms for failing to deliver Duke Nukem Forever Pitchford who had prior industry relations with many D Realms staff including George Broussard learned that many of the D Realms team were still eager to develop Duke Nukem Forever working out of their homes on what they could Pitchford negotiated with Take Two to bring many of the former D Realms staff into a new studio called Triptych Games housed at Gearbox s headquarters to continue working on Duke Nukem Forever following D Realms closure in As a result D Realms sold the rights to Duke Nukem and the existing work on Duke Nukem Forever to Gearbox around February Take Two and Gearbox subsequently announced in September that Gearbox would finish production of Duke Nukem Forever Duke Nukem Forever was released in June and received negative critical reception on release with most of the criticism directed towards the unfinished rushed state of the game Despite the criticism the game topped the charts on release and made a profit D Realms had initially sued Gearbox in June for unpaid royalties over Duke Nukem Forever but dropped the suit by September with D Realms founder Scott Miller stating that it was a misunderstanding on their part D Realms was eventually acquired in part by Interceptor Entertainment and in Interceptor announced plans to make a new Duke Nukem game Duke Nukem Mass Destruction Gearbox filed suit against D Realms and Interceptor based on the fact that Gearbox now owned the rights to the Duke Nukem franchise The case was settled out of court in August with D Realms and Interceptor acknowledging that Gearbox has full rights to the Duke Nukem series Following the settlement Gearbox released Duke Nukem D th Anniversary Edition World Tour in September The game included new levels developed in conjunction with some of the original developers re recorded lines by original Duke voice actor Jon St John and new music from original composer Lee Jackson It was released on October Aliens Colonial Marines Aliens Colonial Marines was a result of Gearbox s exploration into working on licensed film properties in and was developed under license from th Century Fox who held the film rights and Sega who held the game publishing rights to the franchise Aliens Colonial Marines was planned as a first person shooter both single player and multiplayer with players as members of human squads facing the franchises titular xenomorphs in settings based on the films Gearbox did initial development on the game but as the studio started working on Borderlands and Duke Nukem Forever they drew developers off Aliens though still collected full payments from Sega Sega and K discovered the discrepancy on Gearbox s allocation of its staff on its projects which lead to a round of layoffs in After Gearbox released Borderlands to critical acclaim in it began work on its sequel rather than re allocating developers to Aliens Instead the studio outsourced the work to third parties including Demiurge Studios Nerve Software and TimeGate Studios By Gearbox took over full development of the game as it neared its planned release in February but due to the heavily outsourced process the game s state was haphazard forcing Gearbox to cancel a planned beta period and rush the game through the final stages of production certification and distribution On release the game suffered from performance issues even on target hardware specifications and shipped with a software bug that hampered the artificial intelligence of the xenomorphs in the game making the game far less challenging than promised it was discovered in that this bug was result of a typographic error in a configuration file shipped with the game The game s poor performance led Sega to cancel planned releases for the Wii U A class action lawsuit filed in April by Roger Damion Perrine and John Locke alleged that Gearbox and Sega falsely advertised Aliens Colonial Marines by showing demos at trade shows that did not accurately represent the final product Sega and the plaintiffs reached a settlement in late wherein Sega agreed to pay million to
