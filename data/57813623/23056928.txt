continued in the novel Empire in which the President of the United States is dead and the civil war is about to start A non canonical ending is available midway through the game where Jason can escape the complex and leave Claire to her fate Development Chair Entertainment s creative director Donald Mustard stated that much of Shadow Complex is based around the gameplay of Super Metroid a game he considers the pinnacle of D game design Much of their effort was in creating the Metroid style of gameplay a first for their company The first month of development was spent having the team replaying the various Metroid games in order to establish the language and concepts of such games for development in order to expand on enjoyable sections while avoiding the mistakes of these games Chair s design process started by drawing out the game s world on graph paper using the concepts of tile based games to craft out the world despite the final game not being tile based This process set certain rules such as how high the character may jump with the various upgrades or how far the character must run before a certain power would activate They played out the game on this paper map to make sure that all parts of the game were possible to complete Such a map was used to help with the game s pacing making sure that the player s interest in the game would remain despite the acquisition of more and more powerups Roughly six months into development they recognized that their initial selected jump height was too large and did not fit with the game forcing the team to redesign the map with a smaller jump height Mustard noted this was one of the few changes they made that hurt but was caught early enough in the process to be repaired The team had to consider the impact of the variety of power ups they wanted to include made more complex by their desire to have the power ups usable anywhere For example while other games would specifically limit the use of a hookshot to specific surfaces Chair s developers sought to have their tool usable on any surface and had to consider all the potentially game breaking routes that would be created by introducing the tool too early Several iterations of this paper map were performed though Mustard noted that about of their original design remained in the final map With a brush stroke tool within the Unreal Engine they were able to build out their drawn map into the D computer engine using a cylinder to represent the player After working on tightening the feel of the player s movement controls with the simplistic map they began prototyping the rest of the game Though the game is directly influenced by Metroid the development team had to alter some of the series principles due to the non tile nature of the game Mustard noted that many players in the Metroid games would bomb every square to discover secret areas but this would not translate to Shadow Complex Instead they relied on the use of lighting to focus the player s attention on certain areas and created the flashlight tool in the game in order to highlight such secrets when illuminated They further used lighting and a low depth of field to reduce the amount of perspective in the game s D view to allow key features of the game world to stand out for the player without sacrificing the D nature of the game Much of the game s month development time was focused on the game s controls and making sure they worked as Mustard believed that without controls that feel sweet the game would have been poorly received This included the incorporation of weapon aiming through the right thumbstick and other tactical elements such as firing from cover from games such as Gears of War With the game being published by Microsoft Studios the development team had access to the Microsoft play testers who helped to identify other problem areas with their original level design This led to the development of the option to show a blue line on the game s map that would show the player where to go next Mustard realized there was both a benefit and downside to this feature as it would help guide players that were stuck but at the same time players could become too dependent on the line and follow it exactly giving them no challenge in exploring the game s world To counter this they had the line show the general path that needed to be taken but included parts of their world where the player would be forced to deviate from the suggested path in order to work around an obstacle or collect a required power up Mustard believed the minimalistic story approach in Super Metroid to be ideal and while he considered the narrative story presented in Metroid Fusion to be an obvious extension felt it was too detailed Thus the development team chose to use minimal dialogue aiming to allow the story to be pushed forward through the setting and design of the game Shadow Complex s story further arose from the development team s common love of the cartoon G I Joe pitting heroes against enemies with advanced technology As Mustard and others at Chair had worked with Orson Scott Card during the development of Advent Rising they approached him for feedback on the story they had been considering for the game Card offered the idea of a faction of the United States that wanted to create a more imperialistic government which fit well with Chair s initial concept Card enthralled with the idea licensed the literary rights from Chair and proceeded to write Empire fleshing out the story beyond the framework that Shadow Complex would fit in while Chair completed work on its previous game Undertow Once Chair was ready to begin work on Shadow Complex they approached comic book writer Peter David to create the backstory for the game that would run parallel to the events in Card s novel Developed under the working titles Empire and Empire Alpha Complex little was revealed during this time with speculation that the game would be a first person shooter Mustard cited David s ability to remain creative when certain events were already scripted in this case the events of Empire and its sequel Hidden Empire as a key asset towards the game s story Reception Shadow Complex has been met with positive reviews and has been nominated for or received several Game of the Year E and Editor s Choice Awards IGN has given the game a out of stating it to be one of the best games of the year specifically praising its lasting appeal and graphics though having minor issue with the sometimes frustrating aiming Ars Technica gave it the verdict Buy stating

estimated that the game has sold nearly units based on leaderboard statistics within a year of its release That number increased to over as of year end Controversy Shortly before the game s release some activists considered calling for a boycott of Shadow Complex due to Orson Scott Card s views on homosexuality Possible sequel and remastered version Chair has considered a sequel to Shadow Complex and had started working on development after the release of the first game At that time both Mustard and executives at Epic Games were considering possibilities for mobile games based on the success of spirit based titles like Fieldrunners Around mid about eight to nine months after the release of Shadow Complex and into the development of its sequel Apple was preparing to announce the iPhone which they said would offer enough processor power to run games using a D engine Mustard got into contact with Apple with the offer to develop a game for the iPhone and Apple allowed them to but required completion of the title in a very short timeframe approximately five months as to have it ready for the iPhone release event Because of the limited size of Chair they could only work on one project at a time Over one weekend Mustard halted the development of the Shadow Complex sequel and put his team on developing Infinity Blade which proved successful the title had two further sequels During this time Mustard stated that they were stockpiling ideas for the Shadow Complex sequel after they completed Infinity Blade Though they do not expect a sequel to perform as well as Infinity Blade they have pledged that a sequel will be made In a March interview Mustard stated that the sequel s map and core game is in a playable state but would need about a year and a half to add art assets enemy behavior and other mechanics needed to polish the title When the third Infinity Blade title was completed in September Chair was looking to return to Shadow Complex but a new opportunity came about as Apple had introduced Chair to Bad Robot the production company of film and television director J J Abrams The two companies recognized a potential game could be developed Chair spent the next two years working on Spyjinx which is set to be released in During as Spyjinx s development continued Mustard recognized that Chair had grown large and mature enough to handle a second project He opted to have part of his team create Shadow Complex Remastered using the help of a friendly third party studio to help port the game to the Unreal Engine giving the game more realistic rendering capabilities enabled by the nature of the original game assets being developed at high resolution Chair included keyboard and mouse controls for personal computer users and added in new melee takedown maneuvers as these were already developed for the anticipated sequel The Remastered version includes new achievements and Master challenges However Mustard did not want to add many other new features to the game wanting to leave the game otherwise untouched for experienced players Shadow Complex Remastered was made available for free download on Microsoft Windows through Epic s storefront on December with plans for wider Windows release on other storefronts The Windows version was released for free during its first month Mustard said that Chair was financially secure to enable this decision and found that through Infinity Blade that releasing the title for free would allow them to get it to as many players as possible and to see what interest there is for pursuing a sequel The remastered version was released on Xbox One on March and a PlayStation version as well as PC version offered through the Windows Store and Steam on May A physical printing of the remaster was made by Limited Run Games with copies being produced for the PlayStation and was released on the distributor s website on August Of the only were made available for sale with the rest being given
