Latin either I collect I compose I choose or I read These additional meanings the first three of which are very relevant only made sense when the company started making plastic blocks with knobs Lego blocks so that they could be put together Trademark and patents Since the expiry of the last standing Lego patent in several companies have produced interlocking bricks that are similar to Lego bricks The toy company Tyco Toys produced such bricks for a time other competitors include Mega Bloks and Best Lock These competitor products are typically compatible with Lego bricks and are often marketed at a lower cost than Lego sets One such competitor is Coko manufactured by Chinese company Tianjin Coko Toy Co Ltd In Lego Group s Swiss subsidiary Interlego AG sued the company for copyright infringement A trial court found many Coko bricks to be infringing Coko was ordered to cease manufacture of the infringing bricks publish a formal apology in the Beijing Daily and pay a small fee in damages to Interlego On appeal the Beijing High People s Court upheld the trial court s ruling In the Lego Group won a lawsuit in Norway against the marketing group Biltema for its sale of Coko products because the company used product confusion for marketing purposes Also in a large shipment of Lego like products marketed under the name Enlighten was seized by Finnish customs authorities The packaging of the Enlighten products was similar to official Lego packaging Their Chinese manufacturer failed to appear in court and thus Lego won a default action ordering the destruction of the shipment Lego Group footed the bill for the disposal of the sets citing a desire to avoid brand confusion and protect consumers from potentially inferior products In Best Lock defeated a patent challenge from Lego in the Oberlandesgericht Hamburg The Lego Group has attempted to trademark the Lego Indicia the studded appearance of the Lego brick hoping to stop production of Mega Brands On May

Appeal on July In October the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Trademark law should not be used to perpetuate monopoly rights enjoyed under now expired patents and held that Mega Bloks can continue to manufacture their bricks Because of fierce competition from copycat products the company has always responded by being proactive in its patenting and has over United States granted design patents to its name Financial results In the Lego Group faced a budget deficit of kr billion US million at then current exchange rates equal to million causing Poul Plougmann to be replaced by Kjeld
