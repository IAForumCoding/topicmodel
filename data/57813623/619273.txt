Shooter video games or shooters are a subgenre of action video games where the focus is on the defeat of the character s enemies using ranged weapons given to the player Usually these weapons are firearms or some other long range weapons and can be used in combination with other tools such as grenades for indirect offense armor for additional defense or accessories such as telescopic sights to modify the behavior of the weapons A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition armor or health or upgrades which augment the player character s weapons Shooter games test the player s spatial awareness reflexes and speed in both isolated single player or networked multiplayer environments Shooter games encompass many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar engaging in combat with a weapon against both code driven NPC enemies or other avatars controlled by other players Subgenres Shoot em up Shoot em ups also known as shmups are a subgenre of shooters wherein the player may move up down left or right around the screen typically firing straight forward Shoot em ups share common gameplay but are often categorized by viewpoint This includes fixed shooters on fixed screens such as Space Invaders and Galaxian scrolling shooters that mainly scroll in a single direction such as Xevious and Darius top down shooters sometimes referred to as twin stick shooters where the levels are controlled from an overhead viewpoint such as Bosconian and Time Pilot rail shooters where player movement is automatically guided down a fixed forward scrolling rail such as Buck Rogers Planet of Zoom and Space Harrier and isometric shooters which use an isometric perspective such as Zaxxon and Viewpoint Run and gun Run and gun video games are D scrolling action games in which the protagonists fight on foot often with the ability to jump Run and gun games may use side scrolling vertical scrolling or isometric viewpoints and may feature multidirectional movement Top down run and gun games use an overhead camera angle that shows players and the areas around them from above Notable games in this category include Commando Ikari Warriors Shock Troopers and Shock Troopers nd Squad Side scrolling run and gun games combine elements of both shoot em up and platform games while the player characters move and jump around shooting with various guns and other long range weapons These games emphasize greater maneuvering or even jumping such as Green Beret Thexder Contra and Metal Slug Shooting gallery Shooting gallery games also known as target shooting games are a sub genre of shooters where the player aims at moving targets on a stationary screen They are distinguished from rail shooters which move the player through levels on a fixed path and first person shooters which allow player guided navigation through a three dimensional space Shooting gallery games can be light gun games and rail shooters although many can also be played using a regular joypad and an on screen cursor to signify where the bullets are being aimed When these debuted they were typically played from a first person perspective with enemy fire that occurred anywhere on the screen damaging or killing the player As they evolved away from the use of light guns the player came to be represented by an on screen avatar usually someone on the bottom of the screen who could move and avoid enemy attacks while returning fire These sorts of shooters almost always utilize horizontal scrolling to the right to indicate level progression with enemies appearing in waves from predestined locations in the background or from the sides One of the earliest examples is the arcade game Shootout produced by Data East As light gun games and rail shooters became more prevalent and started to make use of scrolling backgrounds such as Operation Wolf or fully D backgrounds such as the Time Crisis or House of the Dead series these sorts of games fell out of popular production but many like Blood Bros still have their fanbase today Other notable games of this category include Cabal and Wild Guns Light gun shooter Light gun shooters are shooters designed for use with a gun shaped controller typically a light gun in arcade games similar control methods include a positional gun motion controller pointing device or analog stick The first light guns appeared in the s following the development of light sensing vacuum tubes It was not long before the technology began appearing in mechanical shooting arcade games dating back to the Seeburg Ray O Lite in These early mechanical gun games evolved into shooting electro mechanical games around the mid th century and in turn evolved into light gun shooter video games in the s Early mechanical light gun games used small targets usually moving onto which a light sensing tube was mounted the player used a gun usually a rifle that emitted a beam of light when the trigger was pulled If the beam struck the target a hit was scored Modern screen based video game light guns work on the opposite principle the sensor is built into the gun itself and the on screen target s emit light rather than the gun The first light gun of this type was used on the MIT Whirlwind computer which used a similar light pen Like rail shooters movement is typically limited in light gun games Notable games of this category include the and versions of Wild Gunman Duck Hunt for the NES Operation Wolf Lethal Enforcers the Virtua Cop series Time Crisis series The House of the Dead series and Resident Evil The Umbrella Chronicles Darkside Chronicles First person shooter FPS First person shooters are characterized by an on screen representation of the player character s perspective within a three dimensional space with the player having control and agency over the character s movement and action within that space While many rail shooters and light gun shooters also use a first person perspective they are generally not included in this category as the player generally lacks agency to move their character within the game world Notable examples of the genre include Doom Quake Counter Strike GoldenEye Battlefield Medal of Honor Unreal Call of Duty Killzone TimeSplitters Team Fortress and Halo while games such as Half Life and System Shock would combine shooter gameplay with narrative focused or role playing game elements to instead branch off into the immersive sim genre Boomer shooter Boomer shooter is a term used to describe newer FPS games s and later that are purposely designed to emulate the style and design principles of s FPS games like Doom and Quake The name boomer shooter is derived from the baby boomer generation where boomer has since become slang for anything old or antiquated According to New Blood Interactive CEO Dave Oshry the term originated following the release of Dusk with fans of that game quickly coining the term Newer triple A games like Wolfenstein The New Order and Doom helped to repopularize these styles of shooters in the mid s and indie developers further contributed to the field with games like Amid Evil Ion Fury and Ultrakill Third person shooter TPS Third person shooters are characterized by a third person camera view that fully displays the player character in their surroundings Notable examples of the genre include Fortnite the Tomb Raider series several entries in the Resident Evil and Metal Gear Solid franchises Syphon Filter Max Payne SOCOM Star Wars Battlefront Gears of War and Splatoon Third person shooter mechanics are often incorporated into open world adventure and sandbox games including the Elder Scrolls series and the Grand Theft Auto franchise FPS TPS variations Arena shooter Arena shooters are multiplayer games that feature fast paced gameplay that emphasize quick speed and agile movement and played out on levels or maps of limited size the arena Many of these are presented as first person shooters and thus arena FPS may also be used to describe a subset of these games Examples of these include the Quake and Unreal series more specifically Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament which first pioneered the genre Arena shooters can also be played from other perspectives such as via a top down view in games like Robotron and Geometry Wars Arena shooters frequently emphasize multiplayer modes with few or no single player modes outside of practice matches with computer controlled opponents The genre hit its peak in popularity in the late s and early s Hero shooter Hero shooters are a variation of multiplayer first or third person shooters where players form into two or more teams and select from pre designed hero characters with each possessing distinctive abilities and or weapons that are specific to them Hero shooters strongly encourage teamwork between players on a team guiding players to select effective combinations of hero characters and coordinate the use of hero abilities during a match Outside of a match players have the ability to customize the appearance of these characters but these changes are usually cosmetic only and do not alter the game s balance or the behavior of the hero Hero shooters take many of their design elements from older class based shooter multiplayer online battle arena and fighting games The class based shooter Team Fortress is considered to be the codifier of the hero shooter genre Popular hero shooters include Overwatch Paladins Apex Legends and Valorant Hero shooters have been considered to have strong potential as esports games as a large degree of skill and coordination arises from the importance of teamwork Tactical shooter Tactical shooters are shooters that generally simulate realistic squad based or man to man skirmishes Notable examples of the genre include Ubisoft s Tom Clancy s Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon series and Bohemia Software s Operation Flashpoint A common feature of tactical shooters that is not present in many other shooters is the ability for the player character to lean out of cover increasing the granularity of a player s movement and stance options to enhance the realism of the game Tactical shooters also commonly feature more extensive equipment management more complex healing systems and greater depth of simulation compared to other shooters As a result of this many tactical shooters are commonly played from the first person perspective Tactical shooters may combine elements from other shooter genres such as Rainbow Six Siege Valorant and Squad which combine the traditional tactical shooter style with the class based gameplay of hero shooters A further variant of the tactical shooter is the extraction shooter generally defined by the gameplay style of Escape from Tarkov These games are often player versus player versus environment PvPvE where players are grouped into teams and placed on a map with the goal to reach an extraction point elsewhere on the map while avoiding the opposing team and non player character enemies During their attempt to reach the extraction point the players may try to loot the opposing team or other features on the map for gear which if they successfully reach the extraction point they can keep and use to improve their character Alternatively they may have other assigned objectives to complete before extraction for better rewards Gameplay is more slow and tactical for survival rather than straightforward run and gun Other examples of extraction shooters include The Cycle Frontier and the upcoming revival of the Marathon series Looter shooter Looter shooters are shooter games where the player s overarching goal is the accumulation of loot weapons equipment armor accessories and resources To achieve this players complete tasks framed as quests missions or campaigns and are rewarded with better weapons gear and accessories as a result with the qualities attributes and perks of such gear generated randomly following certain rarity scales also known as loot tables The better gear allows players to take on more difficult missions with potentially more powerful rewards forming the game s compulsion loop Loot shooters are inspired by similar loot based action role playing games like Diablo Examples of loot shooters include the Borderlands franchise Warframe Destiny and its sequel and Tom Clancy s The Division and its sequel Artillery game Artillery games have been described as a type of shooting game though they are more frequently classified as a type of strategy game Battle royale Battle royale games are a subgenre of action games that combine last man standing gameplay with survival game elements and frequently includes shooter elements It is almost exclusively multiplayer in nature and eschews the complex crafting and resource gathering mechanics of survival games for a faster paced confrontation game more typical of shooters The genre is named after the Japanese film Battle Royale which itself was based on the novel of the same name and was popularized in video games with PUBG Battlegrounds and Fortnite Battle Royale History The concept of shooting games existed before video games dating back to shooting gallery carnival games in the late th century as well as target sports such as shooting sports bowling cue sports archery and darts Mechanical gun games first appeared in England s amusement arcades around the turn of the th century before appearing in America by the s The British cinematic shooting gallery game Life Targets was a mechanical interactive film game where players shot at a cinema screen displaying film footage of targets The first light guns appeared in the s with the Seeburg Ray O Lite Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and the rifle fired beams of light at targets wired with sensors Shooting gallery games eventually evolved into more sophisticated shooting electro mechanical games EM games such as Sega s influential Periscope Contemporary shooting video games have roots in older EM shooting games Another influential Sega EM shooting game was Gun Fight where two players control cowboy figurines on opposing sides of a playfield full of obstacles with each player attempting to shoot the opponent s cowboy It had a Western theme and was one of the first games to feature competitive head to head shooting between two players inspiring several early Western themed shooter video games s to mid s Spacewar recognized as one of the first video games was also the first shooter video game it featured two players controlling spacecraft trying to fire onto the other player Spacewar was the basis for the first arcade video games Computer Space and Galaxy Game in In the s EM gun games evolved into light gun shooter video games The first home video game console the Magnavox Odyssey shipped with a light gun for a shooting gallery game in In Tank by Kee Games adapted the concept of Computer Space into a more grounded tank combat game with simplified physics and maze game elements becoming a hit in arcades Spasim and Maze War were effectively first person shooter FPS games but had wireframe graphics and lacked the free roaming character movement of later FPS titles In Taito s Tomohiro Nishikado adapted the concept of Sega s EM game Gun Fight into a video game Western Gun with the cowboys represented as character sprites and both players able to maneuver across a landscape while shooting each other making it a milestone for depicting human shooting targets Western Gun became an arcade hit which along with Tank popularized a subgenre of one on one dueling video games Midway s North American localization of Western Gun called Gun Fight also introduced the use of a microprocessor In Midway had another hit shooting video game Sea Wolf which was adapted from another Sega EM game Periscope Late s to s The genre gained major attraction in popular culture with the release of Taito s Space Invaders arcade video game in It established the basis of the shoot em up subgenre and became a cultural phenomenon that led into a golden age of arcade video games that lasted until around In contrast to earlier shooting games Space Invaders has targets that fire back at the player who in turn has multiple lives Designed by Tomohiro Nishikado who combined elements from his earlier Western Gun such as destructible environmental objects with elements of Atari s Breakout and science fiction media Space Invaders established a formula of shoot or be shot against numerous enemies Space shooters subsequently became the dominant genre in arcades from the late s up until the early s Most of these shooting games were presented from a D top down style perspective with either a fixed or scrolling field Games like Space Wars by Cinematronics and Tempest by Atari used vector graphics displays rather than raster graphics while Sega s Zaxxon was the first video game to use an isometric playfield In the early s Japanese arcade developers began moving away from space shooters towards character action games On the other hand American arcade developers continued to focus on space shooters during the early s According to Eugene Jarvis American arcade developers were greatly influenced by Japanese space shooters but took the genre in a different direction from the more deterministic scripted pattern type gameplay of Japanese games towards a more programmer centric design culture emphasizing algorithmic generation of backgrounds and enemy dispatch and an emphasis on random event generation particle effect explosions and physics as seen in arcade games such as his own Defender and Robotron as well as Atari s Asteroids Nevertheless Japanese developers occasionally released defining space shooters in the early s such as Sega s isometric shooter Zaxxon and pseudo D rail shooter Buck Rogers Planet of Zoom demonstrating the potential of D shoot em up gameplay Shooter games diversified by the mid s with first person light gun shooting gallery games such as Nintendo s Duck Hunt pseudo D third person rail shooters such as Sega s Space Harrier and After Burner and military themed scrolling run and gun video games such as Capcom s Commando Konami s Green Beret and SNK s Ikari Warriors In the late s Taito s Operation Wolf popularized military themed first person light gun rail shooters s to present Doom by id Software is considered the first major popular first person shooter FPS and it was a major leap forward for three dimensional environments in shooter games as well as action games in general While first person perspectives had been used by rail shooter and shooting gallery games they lacked player guided navigation through a three dimensional space a defining feature of FPS games The use of texture mapped D polygon graphics in shooter games dates back to Sega AM s light gun rail shooter Virtua Cop followed by Sega s mech simulation shooter Metal Head and Parallax Software s FPS game Descent GoldenEye for the Nintendo later combined the FPS sub genre with light gun rail shooter elements from Virtua Cop popularizing FPS games on consoles In the late s FPS games became increasingly popular while rail shooters declined in popularity as FPS games were generally able to offer more variety depth and sophistication than rail shooters One of the last mainstream light gun rail shooter franchises was The House of the Dead horror game series in the late s which along with Resident Evil had a significant cultural impact on zombie media including zombie films by the s Controversy Due to its violent nature some consider the shooter game genre to be a representation of real world violence Debates regarding video games causing violence were exacerbated by the Columbine High School massacre whose perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were fans of the game Doom Similarly in Germany school shootings such as those at Erfurt Emsdetten and Winnenden resulted in conservative politicians accusing violent shooter games most notably Counter Strike of inciting young gamers to run amok Several attempts were made to ban the Killerspiele killing games in Germany and the European Union Shooter games were further criticized when Anders Behring Breivik perpetrator of the Norway attacks claimed that he developed target acquisition skills by playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare This has led to a plethora of experimental research to determine the true effects Experimental Research focusing on the short term effects found that playing violent games can increase the player s aggression In a Supreme Court case involving a California law Justice Antonio Scalia stated that there was some correlation between violent video games and increased aggression but very little real world effects An experiment by C A Anderson and K E Dill in which they had undergraduates randomly play either a violent or non violent game determined that the students who played the violent game were more susceptible to primed aggressive thoughts Further studies have shown that there are some limitations with the research Many research studies have not taken into account that violent video games tend to be more competitive have a higher playing difficulty and are more fast paced than non violent games Past research also shows that the way aggression was measured in the studies could be compared to the way competitiveness is measured leaving open the question of whether or not the effects of violent video games are forms of aggression or competitiveness See also Combat flight simulation games many of which contain shooter game elements References
