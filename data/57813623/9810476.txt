A zombie Haitian French zombi Haitian Creole zonbi Kikongo zumbi is a mythological undead corporeal revenant created through the reanimation of a corpse In modern popular culture zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works The term comes from Haitian folklore in which a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods most commonly magical practices in religions like Vodou Modern media depictions of the reanimation of the dead often do not involve magic but rather science fictional methods such as carriers fungi radiation mental diseases vectors pathogens parasites scientific accidents etc The English word zombie was first recorded in in a history of Brazil by the poet Robert Southey in the form of zombi Dictionaries trace the word s origin to African languages relating to words connected to gods ghosts and souls One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was W B Seabrook s The Magic Island the account of a narrator who encounters voodoo cults in Haiti and their resurrected thralls A new version of the zombie distinct from that described in Haitian folklore emerged in popular culture during the latter half of the th century This interpretation of the zombie as an undead person that attacks and eats the flesh of living people is drawn largely from George A Romero s film Night of the Living Dead which was partly inspired by Richard Matheson s novel I Am Legend The word zombie is not used in Night of the Living Dead but was applied later by fans Following the release of such zombie films as Dawn of the Dead and The Return of the Living Dead the latter of which introduced the concept of zombies that eat brains as well as Michael Jackson s music video Thriller the genre waned for some years The mid s saw the introduction of Resident Evil and The House of the Dead two break out successes of video games featuring zombie enemies which would later go on to become highly influential and well known These games were initially followed by a wave of low budget Asian zombie films such as the zombie comedy Bio Zombie and action film Versus and then a new wave of popular Western zombie films in the early s the Resident Evil and House of the Dead films the Dawn of the Dead remake and the British zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead The zombie apocalypse concept in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation has since become a staple of modern popular art seen in such media as The Walking Dead franchise The late s and s saw the humanization and romanticization of the zombie archetype with the zombies increasingly portrayed as friends and love interests for humans Notable examples of the latter include movies Warm Bodies and Zombies novels American Gods by Neil Gaiman Generation Dead by Daniel Waters and Bone Song by John Meaney animated movie Corpse Bride TV series iZombie manga series Sankarea Undying Love and the light novel Is This a Zombie In this context zombies are often seen as stand ins for discriminated groups struggling for equality and the human zombie romantic relationship is interpreted as a metaphor for sexual liberation and taboo breaking given that zombies are subject to wild desires and free from social conventions Etymology In Haitian folklore a zombie Haitian French zombi Haitian Creole zonbi is an animated corpse raised by magical means such as witchcraft The English word zombie is first recorded in in a history of Brazil by the poet Robert Southey in the form of zombi actually referring to the Afro Brazilian rebel leader named Zumbi and the etymology of his name in nzambi The Oxford English Dictionary gives the origin of the word as Central African and compares it to the Kongo words nzambi god and zumbi fetish A Kimbundu to Portuguese dictionary from defines the related word nzumbi as soul while a later Kimbundu Portuguese dictionary defines it as being a spirit that is supposed to wander the earth to torment the living How the creatures in contemporary zombie films came to be called zombies is not fully clear The film Night of the Living Dead made no spoken reference to its undead antagonists as zombies describing them instead as ghouls though ghouls which derive from Arabic folklore are demons not undead Although George A Romero used the term ghoul in his original scripts in later interviews he used the term zombie The word zombie is used exclusively by Romero in his script for his sequel Dawn of the Dead including once in dialog According to Romero film critics were influential in associating the term zombie to his creatures and especially the French magazine Cahiers du Cin ma He eventually accepted this linkage even though he remained convinced at the time that zombies corresponded to the undead slaves of Haitian voodoo as depicted in White Zombie with Bela Lugosi Folk beliefs Haiti Zombies are featured widely in Haitian rural folklore as dead persons physically revived by the act of necromancy of a bokor a sorcerer or witch The bokor is opposed by the houngan priest and the mambo priestess of the formal voodoo religion A zombie remains under the control of the bokor as a personal slave having no will of its own The Haitian tradition also includes an incorporeal type of zombie the zombie astral which is a part of the human soul A bokor can capture a zombie astral to enhance his spiritual power A zombie astral can also be sealed inside a specially decorated bottle by a bokor and sold to a client to bring luck healing or business success It is believed that God eventually will reclaim the zombie s soul so the zombie is a temporary spiritual entity The two types of zombie reflect soul dualism a belief of Bakongo religion and Haitian voodoo Each type of legendary zombie is therefore missing one half of its soul the flesh or the spirit The zombie belief has its roots in traditions brought to Haiti by enslaved Africans and their subsequent experiences in the New World It was thought that the voodoo deity Baron Samedi would gather them from their grave to bring them to a heavenly afterlife in Africa Guinea unless they had offended him in some way in which case they would be forever a slave after death as a zombie A zombie could also be saved by feeding them salt English professor Amy Wilentz has written that the modern concept of Zombies was strongly influenced by Haitian slavery Slave drivers on the plantations who were usually slaves themselves and sometimes voodoo priests used the fear of zombification to discourage slaves from committing suicide While most scholars have associated the Haitian zombie with African cultures a connection has also been suggested to the island s indigenous Ta no people partly based on an early account of native shamanist practices written Ram n Pan a monk of the Hieronymite religious order and companion of Christopher Columbus The Haitian zombie phenomenon first attracted widespread international attention during the United States occupation of Haiti when a number of case histories of purported zombies began to emerge The first popular book covering the topic was William Seabrook s The Magic Island Seabrooke cited Article of the Haitian criminal code which was passed in asserting that it was an official recognition of zombies This passage was later used in promotional materials for the film White Zombie Also shall be qualified as attempted murder the employment which may be made by any person of substances which without causing actual death produce a lethargic coma more or less prolonged If after the administering of such substances the person has been buried the act shall be considered murder no matter what result follows In while researching folklore in Haiti Zora Neale Hurston encountered the case of a woman who appeared in a village A family claimed that she was Felicia Felix Mentor a relative who had died and been buried in at the age of The woman was examined by a doctor X rays indicated that she did not have a leg fracture that Felix Mentor was known to have had Hurston pursued rumors that affected persons were given a powerful psychoactive drug but she was unable to locate individuals willing to offer much information She wrote What is more if science ever gets to the bottom of Vodou in Haiti and Africa it will be found that some important medical secrets still unknown to medical science give it its power rather than gestures of ceremony Kongo A Central African origin for the Haitian zombie has been postulated based on two etymologies in the Kongo language nzambi god and zumbi fetish This root helps form the names of several deities including the Kongo creator deity Nzambi Mpungu and the Louisiana serpent deity Li Grand Zombi a local version of the Haitian Damballa but it is in fact a generic word for a divine spirit The common African conception of beings under these names is more similar to the incorporeal zombie astral as in the Kongo Nkisi spirits A related but also often incorporeal undead being is the jumbee of the English speaking Caribbean considered to be of the same etymology in the French West Indies also local zombies are recognized but these are of a more general spirit nature South Africa The idea of physical zombie like creatures is present in some South African cultures where they are called xidachane in Sotho Tsonga and maduxwane in Venda In some communities it is believed that a dead person can be zombified by a small child It is said that the spell can be broken by a powerful enough sangoma It is also believed in some areas of South Africa that witches can zombify a person by killing and possessing the victim s body to force it into slave labor After rail lines were built to transport migrant workers stories emerged about witch trains These trains appeared ordinary but were staffed by zombified workers controlled by a witch The trains would abduct a person boarding at night and the person would then either be zombified or beaten and thrown from the train a distance away from the original location Origin hypotheses Chemical Several decades after Hurston s work Wade Davis a Harvard ethnobotanist presented a pharmacological case for zombies in a article in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology and later in two popular books The Serpent and the Rainbow and Passage of Darkness The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie Davis traveled to Haiti in and as a result of his investigations claimed that a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being introduced into the bloodstream usually through a wound The first French coup de poudre powder strike includes tetrodotoxin TTX a powerful and frequently fatal neurotoxin found in the flesh of the pufferfish family Tetraodontidae The second powder consists of deliriant drugs such as datura Together these powders were said to induce a deathlike state in which the will of the victim would be entirely subjected to that of the bokor Davis also popularized the story of Clairvius Narcisse who was claimed to have succumbed to this practice The most ethically questioned and least scientifically explored ingredient of the powders is part of a recently buried child s brain The process described by Davis was an initial state of deathlike suspended animation followed by re awakening typically after being buried into a psychotic state The psychosis induced by the drug and psychological trauma was hypothesised by Davis to reinforce culturally learned beliefs and to cause the individual to reconstruct their identity as that of a zombie since they knew that they were dead and had no other role to play in the Haitian society Societal reinforcement of the belief was hypothesized by Davis to confirm for the zombie individual the zombie state and such individuals were known to hang around in graveyards exhibiting attitudes of low affect Davis s claim has been criticized particularly the suggestion that Haitian witch doctors can keep zombies in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years Symptoms of TTX poisoning range from numbness and nausea to paralysis particularly of the muscles of the diaphragm unconsciousness and death but do not include a stiffened gait or a deathlike trance According to psychologist Terence Hines the scientific community dismisses tetrodotoxin as the cause of this state and Davis assessment of the nature of the reports of Haitian zombies is viewed as overly credulous Social Scottish psychiatrist R D Laing highlighted the link between social and cultural expectations and compulsion in the context of schizophrenia and other mental illness suggesting that schizogenesis may account for some of the psychological aspects of zombification Particularly this suggests cases where schizophrenia manifests a state of catatonia Roland Littlewood professor of anthropology and psychiatry published a study supporting a social explanation of the zombie phenomenon in the medical journal The Lancet in The social explanation sees observed cases of people identified as zombies as a culture bound syndrome with a particular cultural form of adoption practiced in Haiti that unites the homeless and mentally ill with grieving families who see them as their returned lost loved ones as Littlewood summarizes his findings in an article in Times Higher Education I came to the conclusion that although it is unlikely that there is a single explanation for all cases where zombies are recognised by locals in Haiti the mistaken identification of a wandering mentally ill stranger by bereaved relatives is the most likely explanation in many cases People with a chronic schizophrenic illness brain damage or learning disability are not uncommon in rural Haiti and they would be particularly likely to be identified as zombies Modern archetype evolution Pulliam and Fonseca and Walz trace the zombie lineage back to ancient Mesopotamia In the Descent of Ishtar the goddess Ishtar threatens She repeats this same threat in a slightly modified form in the Epic of Gilgamesh One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was The Magic Island by W B Seabrook This is the sensationalized account of a narrator who encounters voodoo cults in Haiti and their resurrected thralls Time commented that the book introduced zombi into U S speech Zombies have a complex literary heritage with antecedents ranging from Richard Matheson and H P Lovecraft to Mary Shelley s Frankenstein drawing on European folklore of the undead Victor Halperin directed White Zombie a horror film starring Bela Lugosi Here zombies are depicted as mindless unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician Zombies often still using this voodoo inspired rationale were initially uncommon in cinema but their appearances continued sporadically through the s to the s with films including I Walked with a Zombie and Plan from Outer Space Frankenstein by Mary Shelley while not a zombie novel per se foreshadows many th century ideas about zombies in that the resurrection of the dead is portrayed as a scientific process rather than a mystical one and that the resurrected dead are degraded and more violent than their living selves Frankenstein published in has its roots in European folklore whose tales of the vengeful dead also informed the evolution of the modern conception of the vampire Later notable th century stories about the avenging undead included Ambrose Bierce s The Death of Halpin Frayser and various Gothic Romanticism tales by Edgar Allan Poe Though their works could not be properly considered zombie fiction the supernatural tales of Bierce and Poe would prove influential on later writers such as H P Lovecraft by Lovecraft s own admission In the s and early s Lovecraft wrote several novellae that explored the undead theme Cool Air In the Vault and The Outsider all deal with the undead but Lovecraft s Herbert West Reanimator helped define zombies in popular culture This series of short stories featured Herbert West a mad scientist who attempts to revive human corpses with mixed results Notably the resurrected dead are uncontrollable mostly mute primitive and extremely violent though they are not referred to as zombies their portrayal was prescient anticipating the modern conception of zombies by several decades Edgar Rice Burroughs similarly depicted animated corpses in the second book of his Venus series again without using the terms zombie or undead Avenging zombies would feature prominently in the early s EC Comics which George A Romero would later claim as an influence The comics including Tales from the Crypt The Vault of Horror and Weird Science featured avenging undead in the Gothic tradition quite regularly including adaptations of Lovecraft s stories which included In the Vault Cool Air and Herbert West Reanimator Richard Matheson s novel I Am Legend although classified as a vampire story had a great impact on the zombie genre by way of George A Romero The novel and its film adaptation The Last Man on Earth which concern a lone human survivor waging war against a world of vampires would by Romero s own admission greatly influence his low budget film Night of the Living Dead a work that was more influential on the concept of zombies than any literary or cinematic work before it The monsters in the film and its sequels such as Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead as well as the many zombie films it inspired such as The Return of the Living Dead and Zombi are usually hungry for human flesh although Return of the Living Dead introduced the popular concept of zombies eating human brains There has been an evolution in the zombie archetype from supernatural to scientific themes I Am Legend and Night of the Living Dead began the shift away from Haitian dark magic though did not give scientific explanations for zombie origins A more decisive shift towards scientific themes came with the Resident Evil video game series in the late s which gave more realistic scientific explanations for zombie origins while drawing on modern science and technology such as biological weaponry genetic manipulation and parasitic symbiosis This became the standard approach for explaining zombie origins in popular fiction that followed Resident Evil There has also been shift towards an action approach which has led to another evolution of the zombie archietype the fast zombie or running zombie In contrast to Romero s classic slow zombies fast zombies can run are more aggressive and are often more intelligent This type of zombie has origins in s Japanese horror video games In Capcom s survival horror video game Resident Evil featured zombie dogs that run towards the player Later the same year Sega s arcade shooter The House of the Dead introduced running human zombies who run towards the player and can also jump and swim The running human zombies introduced in The House of the Dead video games became the basis for the fast zombies that became popular in zombie films during the early st century starting with Days Later the Resident Evil and House of the Dead films and the Dawn of the Dead remake These films also adopted an action approach to the zombie concept which was also influenced by the Resident Evil and House of the Dead video games Depictions in popular culture Film and television Films featuring zombies have been a part of cinema since the s White Zombie directed by Victor Halperin in and I Walked with a Zombie directed by Jacques Tourneur were early examples With George A Romero s Night of the Living Dead the zombie trope began to be increasingly linked to consumerism and consumer culture Today zombie films are released with such regularity at least films were released in alone that they constitute a separate subgenre of horror film Voodoo related zombie themes have also appeared in espionage or adventure themed works outside the horror genre For example the original Jonny Quest series and the James Bond novel Live and Let Die as well as its film adaptation both feature Caribbean villains who falsely claim the voodoo power of zombification to keep others in fear of them George Romero s modern zombie archetype in Night of the Living Dead was influenced by several earlier zombie themed films including White Zombie Revolt of the Zombies and The Plague of the Zombies Romero was also inspired by Richard Matheson s novel I Am Legend along with its film adaptation The Last Man on Earth George A Romero The modern conception of the zombie owes itself almost entirely to George A Romero s film Night of the Living Dead In his films Romero bred the zombie with the vampire and what he got was the hybrid vigour of a ghoulish plague monster This entailed an apocalyptic vision of monsters that have come to be known as Romero zombies Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film I don t think the younger kids really knew what hit them complained Ebert They were used to going to movies sure and they d seen some horror movies before sure but this was something else According to Ebert the film affected the audience immediately The kids in the audience were stunned There was almost complete silence The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through and had become unexpectedly terrifying There was a little girl across the aisle from me maybe nine years old who was sitting very still in her seat and crying Romero s reinvention of zombies is notable in terms of its thematics he used zombies not just for their own sake but as a vehicle to criticize real world social ills such as government ineptitude bioengineering slavery greed and exploitation while indulging our post apocalyptic fantasies Night was the first of six films in Romero s Living Dead series Its first sequel Dawn of the Dead was released in Lucio Fulci s Zombi was released just months after Dawn of the Dead as an ersatz sequel Dawn of the Dead was released in several other countries as Zombi or Zombie Dawn of the Dead was the most commercially successful zombie film for decades up until the zombie revival of the s The film Hell of the Living Dead referenced a mutagenic gas as a source of zombie contagion an idea also used in Dan O Bannon s film Return of the Living Dead Return of the Living Dead featured zombies that hungered specifically for human brains Relative Western decline Zombie films in the s and s were not as commercially successful as Dawn of the Dead in the late s The mid s produced few zombie films of note Perhaps the most notable entry the Evil Dead trilogy while highly influential are not technically zombie films but films about demonic possession despite the presence of the undead s Re Animator loosely based on the Lovecraft story stood out in the genre achieving nearly unanimous critical acclaim and becoming a modest success nearly outstripping Romero s Day of the Dead for box office returns After the mid s the subgenre was mostly relegated to the underground Notable entries include director Peter Jackson s ultra gory film Braindead released as Dead Alive in the U S Bob Balaban s comic film My Boyfriend s Back where a self aware high school boy returns to profess his love for a girl and his love for human flesh and Michele Soavi s Dellamorte Dellamore released as Cemetery Man in the U S Early Asian films In s Hong Kong cinema the Chinese jiangshi a zombie like creature dating back to Qing dynasty era jiangshi fiction of the th and th centuries were featured in a wave of jiangshi films popularised by Mr Vampire Hong Kong jiangshi films were popular in the Far East from the mid s to the early s Prior to the s there were not many Japanese films related to what may be considered in the West as a zombie film Early films such as The Discarnates feature little gore and no cannibalism but it is about the dead returning to life looking for love rather than a story of apocalyptic destruction One of the earliest Japanese zombie films with considerable gore and violence was Battle Girl The Living Dead in Tokyo Bay Far East revival According to Kim Newman in the book Nightmare Movies the zombie revival began in the Far East during the late s largely inspired by two Japanese zombie games released in Capcom s Resident Evil which started the Resident Evil video game series that went on to sell million copies worldwide by and Sega s arcade shooter House of the Dead The success of these two zombie games inspired a wave of Asian zombie films From the late s zombies experienced a renaissance in low budget Asian cinema with a sudden spate of dissimilar entries including Bio Zombie Wild Zero Junk Versus and Stacy Most Japanese zombie films emerged in the wake of Resident Evil such as Versus Wild Zero and Junk all from The zombie films released after Resident Evil behaved similarly to the zombie films of the s except that they were influenced by zombie video games which inspired them to dwell more on the action compared to the older Romero films Global film revival The zombie revival which began in the Far East eventually went global following the worldwide success of the Japanese zombie games Resident Evil and The House of the Dead Resident Evil in particular sparked a revival of the zombie genre in popular culture leading to a renewed global interest in zombie films during the early s In addition to being adapted into the Resident Evil and House of the Dead films from onwards the original video games themselves also inspired zombie films such as Days Later and Shaun of the Dead This led to the revival of zombie films in global popular culture The turn of the millennium coincided with a decade of box office successes in which the zombie subgenre experienced a resurgence the Resident Evil movies the British films Days Later and Weeks Later the Dawn of the Dead remake and the comedies Shaun of the Dead and Dance of the Dead The new interest allowed Romero to create the fourth entry in his zombie series Land of the Dead released in the summer of Romero returned to the series with the films Diary of the Dead and Survival of the Dead Generally the zombies in these shows are the slow lumbering and unintelligent kind first made popular in Night of the Living Dead The Resident Evil films Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake all set box office records for the zombie genre reaching levels of commercial success not seen since the original Dawn of the Dead in Motion pictures created in the s like Days Later the House of the Dead and Resident Evil films and the Dawn of the Dead remake have featured zombies that are more agile vicious intelligent and stronger than the traditional zombie These new type of zombies the fast zombie or running zombie have origins in video games with Resident Evil s running zombie dogs and especially The House of the Dead game s running human zombies Spillover to television The success of Shaun of the Dead led to more successful zombie comedies during the late s to early s such as Zombieland and Cockneys vs Zombies By the Resident Evil film adaptations had also become the highest grossing film series based on video games after they grossed more than billion worldwide In the AMC series The Walking Dead had the highest audience ratings in the United States for any show on broadcast or cable with an average of million viewers in the to year old demographic The film World War Z became the highest grossing zombie film and one of the highest grossing films of At the same time starting from the mid s a new type of zombie film has been growing in popularity the one in which zombies are portrayed as humanlike in appearance and behavior retaining the personality traits they had in life and becoming friends or even romantic partners for humans rather than a threat to humanity Notable examples of human zombie romance include the stop motion animated movie Corpse Bride live action movies Warm Bodies Camille Life After Beth Burying the Ex and Nina Forever and TV series Pushing Daisies and Babylon Fields According to zombie scholar Scott Rogers what we are seeing in Pushing Daisies Warm Bodies and iZombie is in many ways the same transformation of the zombies that we have witnessed with vampires since the Dracula represented Dracula as essentially human a significant departure from the monstrous representation in the film Nosferatu Rogers also notes the accompanying visual transformation of the living dead while the traditional zombies are marked by noticeable disfigurement and decomposition the romantic zombies show little or no such traits Return to decline present In the late s zombie films began declining in popularity with elevated horror films gradually taking their place such as The Witch Get Out A Quiet Place and Hereditary An exception is the low budget Japanese zombie comedy One Cut of the Dead which became a sleeper hit in Japan and it made box office history by earning over a thousand times its budget One Cut of the Dead also received worldwide acclaim with Rotten Tomatoes stating that it reanimates the moribund zombie genre with a refreshing blend of formal daring and clever satire The romantic zombie angle still remains popular however the late s and early s saw the release of the TV series American Gods and iZombie as well as the Disney Channel Original Movie Zombies and sequels Zombies and Zombies Apocalypse Intimately tied to the concept of the modern zombie is that of the zombie apocalypse the breakdown of society as a result of an initial zombie outbreak that spreads quickly This archetype has emerged as a prolific subgenre of apocalyptic fiction and has been portrayed in many zombie related media after Night of the Living Dead In a zombie apocalypse a widespread usually global rise of zombies hostile to human life engages in a general assault on civilization Victims of zombies may become zombies themselves This causes the outbreak to become an exponentially growing crisis the spreading phenomenon swamps normal military and law enforcement organizations leading to the panicked collapse of civilized society until only isolated pockets of survivors remain scavenging for food and supplies in a world reduced to a pre industrial hostile wilderness Possible causes for zombie behavior in a modern population can be attributed to viruses bacteria or other phenomena that reduce the mental capacity of humans causing them to behave in a very primitive and destructive fashion Subtext The usual subtext of the zombie apocalypse is that civilization is inherently vulnerable to the unexpected and that most individuals if desperate enough cannot be relied on to comply with the author s ethos The narrative of a zombie apocalypse carries strong connections to the turbulent social landscape of the United States in the s when Night of the Living Dead provided an indirect commentary on the dangers of conformity a theme also explored in the novel The Body Snatchers and associated film Invasion of the Body Snatchers Many also feel that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxieties about the end of the world One scholar concluded that more than any other monster zombies are fully and literally apocalyptic they signal the end of the world as we have known it While zombie apocalypse scenarios are secular they follow a religious pattern based on Christian ideas of an end times war and messiah Simon Pegg who starred in and co wrote the zombie comedy film Shaun of the Dead wrote that zombies were the most potent metaphorical monster According to Pegg whereas vampires represent sex zombies represent death Slow and steady in their approach weak clumsy often absurd the zombie relentlessly closes in unstoppable intractable He expressed his dislike for the trend for fast zombies and argued that they should be slow and inept just as a healthy diet and exercise can delay death zombies are easy to avoid but not forever He also argued that this was essential for making them oddly sympathetic to create tragic anti heroes to be pitied empathised with even rooted for The moment they appear angry or petulant the second they emit furious velociraptor screeches as opposed to the correct mournful moans of longing they cease to possess any ambiguity They are simply mean Story elements Initial contacts with zombies are extremely dangerous and traumatic causing shock panic disbelief and possibly denial hampering survivors ability to deal with hostile encounters The response of authorities to the threat is slower than its rate of growth giving the zombie plague time to expand beyond containment This results in the collapse of the given society Zombies take full control while small groups of the living must fight for their survival The stories usually follow a single group of survivors caught up in the sudden rush of the crisis The narrative generally progresses from the onset of the zombie plague then initial attempts to seek the aid of authorities the failure of those authorities through to the sudden catastrophic collapse of all large scale organization and the characters subsequent attempts to survive on their own Such stories are often squarely focused on the way their characters react to such an extreme catastrophe and how their personalities are changed by the stress often acting on more primal motivations fear self preservation than they would display in normal life Literature In the s zombie fiction emerged as a distinct literary subgenre with the publication of Book of the Dead and its follow up Still Dead Book of the Dead both edited by horror authors John Skipp and Craig Spector Featuring Romero inspired stories from the likes of Stephen King the Book of the Dead compilations are regarded as influential in the horror genre and perhaps the first true zombie literature Horror novelist Stephen King has written about zombies including his short story Home Delivery and his novel Cell concerning a struggling young artist on a trek from Boston to Maine in hopes of saving his family from a possible worldwide outbreak of zombie like maniacs Max Brooks s novel World War Z became a New York Times bestseller Brooks had previously authored The Zombie Survival Guide a zombie themed parody of pop fiction survival guides Brooks has said that zombies are so popular because Other monsters may threaten individual humans but the living dead threaten the entire human race Zombies are slate wipers Seth Grahame Smith s mashup novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies combines the full text of Jane Austen s Pride and Prejudice with a story about a zombie epidemic within the novel s British Regency period setting In Katy Hershbereger of St Martin s Press stated In the world of traditional horror nothing is more popular right now than zombies The living dead are here to stay s and s were marked by a decidedly new type of zombie novel in which zombies retain their humanity and become friends or even romantic partners for humans critics largely attribute this trend to the influence of Stephenie Meyer s vampire series Twilight One of the most prominent examples is Generation Dead by Daniel Waters featuring undead teenagers struggling for equality with the living and a human protagonist falling in love with their leader Other novels of this period involving human zombie romantic relationships include Bone Song by John Meaney American Gods by Neil Gaiman Midnight Tides by Steven Erikson and Amy Plum s Die for Me series much earlier examples dating back to the s are Dragon on a Pedestal by Piers Anthony and Conan the Defiant by Steve Perry Anime and manga There has been a growth in the number of zombie mangas in the first decade of the st century and in a list of Great Zombie Manga Anime News Network s Jason Thompson placed I Am a Hero at number considering it probably the greatest zombie manga ever In second place was Living Corpse and in third was Biomega which he called the greatest science fiction virus zombie manga ever During the late s and early s there were several manga and anime series that humanized zombies by presenting them as protagonists or love interests such as Sankarea Undying Love and Is This a Zombie both debuted in Z Zed was adapted into a live action film in Video and performance art Artist Jillian McDonald has made several works of video art involving zombies and exhibited them in her show Horror Make Up which debuted on September at Art Moving Projects a gallery in Williamsburg Brooklyn Artist Karim Charredib has dedicated his work to the zombie figure In he made a video installation at Villa Savoye called Them wherein zombies walked in the villa like tourists Games Zombies are a common undead creature type fantasy role playing games In Dungeons Dragons zombies are one of the basic undead creature types based on the zombie from folklore as well as more contemporary entertainment Zombies are generally portrayed as supernatural creations with variations such as the Ju ju Sea Zombie and Zombie Lord The Advanced Dungeons Dragons nd edition game however also incorporated a creature called the yellow musk creeper a creeping plant that drains the intelligence of its victims possibly turning them into zombies under the plant s control Ben Woodard found this to be an expression of the seemingly endless morphology of fungal creep and toxicological capacity within the game In video games the release of two horror games Capcom s Resident Evil and Sega s The House of the Dead sparked an international craze for zombie games In George A Romero said that it was the video games Resident Evil and House of the Dead more than anything else that popularised zombies in early st century popular culture The modern fast running zombies have origins in these games with Resident Evil s running zombie dogs and especially House of the Dead s running human zombies which later became a staple of modern zombie films Zombies went on to become a popular theme for video games particularly in the survival horror stealth first person shooter and role playing game genres Important horror fiction media franchises in this area include Resident Evil The House of the Dead Silent Hill Dead Rising Dead Island Left Dead Dying Light State of Decay The Last of Us and the Zombies game modes from the Call of Duty title series A series of games has also been released based on the widely popular TV show The Walking Dead first aired in World of Warcraft first released in is an early example of a video game in which an individual zombie like creature could be chosen as a player character a previous game in the same series Warcraft III allowed a player control over an undead army PopCap Games Plants vs Zombies a humorous tower defense game was an indie hit in featuring in several best of lists at the end of that year The massively multiplayer online role playing game Urban Dead a free grid based browser game where zombies and survivors fight for control of a ruined city is one of the most popular games of its type DayZ a zombie based survival horror mod for ARMA was responsible for over unit sales of its parent game within two months of its release Over a year later the developers of the mod created a standalone version of the same game which was in early access on Steam and so far has sold million copies since its release in December Romero would later opine that he believes that much of the st century obsessions with zombies can be traced more towards video games than films noting that it was not until the film Zombieland that a zombie film was able to gross more than million dollars Outside of video games zombies frequently appear in trading card games such as Magic The Gathering or Yu Gi Oh Trading Card Game which even has a Zombie Type for its monsters as well as in role playing games such as Dungeons Dragons tabletop games such as Zombies and Dead of Winter A Cross Roads Game and tabletop wargames such as Warhammer Fantasy and K The game Humans vs Zombies is a zombie themed live action game played on college campuses Writing for Scientific American Kyle Hill praised the game The Last of Us for its plausibility basing its zombification process on a fictional strain of the parasitic Cordyceps fungus a real world genus whose members control the behavior of their arthropod hosts in zombielike ways to reproduce Despite the plausibility of this mechanism also explored in the novel The Girl with All the Gifts and the film of the same name to date there have been no documented cases of humans infected by Cordyceps Zombie video games have remained popular in the late s as seen with the commercial success of the Resident Evil remake and Days Gone in This enduring popularity may be attributed in part to the fact that zombie enemies are not expected to exhibit significant levels of intelligence making them relatively straightforward to program However less pragmatic advantages such as those related to storytelling and representation are increasingly important American government On May the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC published a graphic novel entitled Preparedness Zombie Apocalypse providing tips to survive a zombie invasion as a fun new way of teaching the importance of emergency preparedness The CDC used the metaphor of a zombie apocalypse to illustrate the value of laying in water food medical supplies and other necessities in preparation for any and all potential disasters be they hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods or hordes of zombies In the U S Department of Defense drafted CONPLAN a training exercise detailing a strategy to defend against a zombie attack Music Michael Jackson s music video Thriller in which he dances with a troupe of zombies has been preserved as a cultural treasure by the Library of Congress National Film Registry Many instances of pop culture media have paid tribute to this video including a gathering of university students dressed as zombies in Mexico City and prisoners in orange jumpsuits recreating the zombie dance in a viral video The Brooklyn hip hop trio Flatbush Zombies incorporate many tropes from zombie fiction and play on the theme of a zombie apocalypse in their music They portray themselves as living dead describing their use of psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin mushrooms as having caused them to experience ego death and rebirth Social activism The zombie also appears as a metaphor in protest songs symbolizing mindless adherence to authority particularly that of law enforcement and the armed forces Well known examples include Fela Kuti s album Zombie and the Cranberries single Zombie Organized zombie walks have been staged either as performance art or as part of protests that parody political extremism or apathy A variation of the zombie walk is the zombie run Here participants do a km run wearing a belt with several flag lives If the chasing zombies capture all of the flags the runner becomes infected If he or
