Reid The pair travelled across American cities where players could challenge them in best of three matches for a chance to win money The duo were challenged by a total of players only about seven of whom managed to beat them The golden age of arcade video games was heralded by Taito s Space Invaders in which popularized the use of a persistent high score for all players Several video games in the next several years followed suit adding other means of tracking high scores such with high score tables that included the players initials in games like Asteroids in High score chasing became a popular activity and a means of competition The Space Invaders Championship held by Atari in was the earliest large scale video game competition attracting more than participants across the United

traditional sport which requires careful planning precise timing and skillful execution Others claim that sports involve physical fitness and physical training and prefer to classify esports as a mind sport Former ESPN president John Skipper described esports in as a competition and not a sport In on an episode of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel the panelist openly laughed at the topic In addition many in the fighting games community maintain a distinction between their competitive gaming competitions and the more commercially connected esports competitions of other genres In the World Championship hosted by the International Esports Federation an esports panel of guests from international sports society discussed the future recognition of esports as a legitimate sport Russia was the first country that classified cybersport as an official sport discipline on July After a series of reforms in Russian sports it was classified as a sport again on March In July it was removed from

event alongside other traditional sports and the later editions of the Asian Indoor Games as well as its successor the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games have always included esports as an official medal event or an exhibition event up to now Moreover the Asian Games which is the Asian top level multi sport competition also included esports as a medal event at the edition esports around games such as Hearthstone Starcraft II and League of Legends were presented as an exhibition event at the Asian Games as a lead in to the games The Southeast Asian Games included six medal events for esports Since World Sailing has held an eSailing World Championship that showed a main sports federation embracing esports The Virtual Regatta race shadowing the Vendee Globe was the first online game believe to have in excess of unique users Ahead of The International which was originally set to take place in Stockholm in the Swedish Sports Confederation voted in June to deny recognition of esports as a sporting event which jeopardized plans for how Valve had arranged the event in regards to travel visas for international players Valve had tried to work with Sweden to accommodate players but eventually rescheduled the event to Romania instead The Commonwealth Games featured esports competitions as a pilot ahead of being a potential full medal event for In Greece in March a law entered into force recognising and regulating esports and in June the relevant federation for esports has been officially given recognition and included in the list of sports federations Olympic Games recognition The Olympic Games are also seen as a potential method to legitimize esports A summit held by the International Olympic Committee IOC in October acknowledged the growing popularity of esports concluding that Competitive esports could be considered as a sporting activity and the players involved prepare and train with an intensity which may be comparable to athletes in traditional sports but would require any games used for the Olympics fitting with the rules and regulations of the Olympic movement Another article by Andy Stout suggests that million people viewed the Worlds Esports competition International Olympic Committee IOC president Thomas Bach has noted that the IOC is troubled by violent games and the lack of a global sanctioning body for esports Bach acknowledged that many Olympic sports originated from violent combat but stated that sport is the civilized expression about this If you have egames where it s about killing somebody this cannot be brought into line with our Olympic values Due to that the IOC suggested that they would approve more esports centered around games that simulate real sports such as the NBA K or FIFA series The issues around esports have not prevented the IOC from exploring what possibilities there are for incorporation into future Olympics In July the IOC and the Global Association of International Sports Federations GAISF held a symposium and invited major figures in esports including Epic Games Mark Rein Blizzard Entertainment s Mike Morhaime and esports players Dario TLO W nsch Jacob Jake Lyon and Se yeon Geguri Kim for these organizations to gain a deeper understanding of esports their impact and likely future development so that they can jointly consider the ways in which they may collaborate to the mutual benefit of all of sport in the years ahead The IOC has tested the potential for esports through exhibition games With support from the IOC Intel sponsored exhibition esports events for StarCraft II and Steep prior to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and five South Korean esports players were part of the Olympic Torch relay A similar exhibition showcase the eGames was held alongside the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro though this was not supported by the IOC During the Eighth Olympic Summit in December the IOC reiterated that it would only consider sports simulating games for any official Olympic event but it would look at two paths for such games in the future those that promoted good physical and mental health lifestyles and virtual reality and augmented reality games that included physical activity In the late s leaders in Japan became involved in helping bring esports to the Summer Olympics and beyond given the country s reputation as a major video game industry centre Esports in Japan had not flourished due to the country s anti gambling laws that also prevent paid professional gaming tournaments but there were efforts starting in late to eliminate this issue At the suggestion of the Tokyo Olympic Games Committee for the Summer Olympics four esports organizations have worked with Japan s leading consumer organization to exempt esports tournaments from gambling law restrictions Takeo Kawamura a member of the Japanese House of Representatives and of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party led a coalition of ruling and opposing politicians to support esports called the Japan esports Union or JeSU Kawamura said that they would be willing to pass laws to further exempt esports as needed so that esports athletes can make a living playing these sports So far this has resulted in the ability of esports players to obtain exemption licenses to allow them to play a similar mechanism needed for professional athletes in other sports in Japan to play professionally The first such licenses were given out in mid July via a tournament held by several video game publishers to award prizes to many players but with JeSU offering these exemption licenses to the top dozen or so players that emerge allowing them to compete in further esports events The Tokyo Olympic Committee has also planned to arrange a number of esports events leading up to the games With the IOC five esports events were set as part of an Olympic Virtual Series from May to June ahead of the games Each event in auto racing baseball cycling rowing and sailing will be managed by an IOC recognized governing body for the sport along with a video game publisher of a game for that sport For example the auto racing event will be based on the Gran Turismo series and overseen by the International Automobile Federation along with Polyphony Digital The baseball cycling and esailing events will be based on eBaseball Powerful Pro Baseball Zwift and Virtual Regatta respectively The organization committee for the Summer Olympics in Paris were in discussions with the IOC and the various professional esports organizations to consider esports for the event citing the need to include these elements to keep the Olympics relevant to younger generations Ultimately the organization committee determined esports were premature to bring to the Games as medal events but have not ruled out other activities related to esports during the Games In September the Olympic Council of Asia announced eight esports games will officially debut as medal sports for the Asian Games in Hangzhou China In December the IOC confirmed its Olympic Virtual Series OVS will return in The first edition of the OVS which ran from May to June featured nearly participants and had more than two million entries In January the IOC announced the appointment of the organization s first ever head of virtual sport tasked with the development of virtual sport for the global Olympic body increasing the organization s engagement with gaming communities and overseeing the Olympic Virtual Series IOC s first licensed non physical sports event The inaugural series included virtual baseball cycling rowing esailing and motorsports events In February the Commonwealth Games Federation announced that esports would be included in the Commonwealth Games as a pilot event with the possibility of it being a medal event in the Games The inaugural Commonwealth Esports Championship had separate branding medals and organization and included both men and women s Dota eFootball and Rocket League events As a follow up to s Olympic Virtual Series the IOC and the Singapore National Olympic Council held the inaugural Olympic Esports Week in Singapore in June Games featured at the event included Tic Tac Bow archery WBSC eBaseball Power Pros baseball Chess com chess Zwift cycling Just Dance dancing Gran Turismo motor sport Virtual Regatta esailing Fortnite sharpshooting Virtual Taekwondo taekwondo Tennis Clash tennis Games A number of games are popular among professional competitors The tournaments which emerged in the mid s coincided with the popularity of fighting games and first person shooters genres which still maintain a devoted fan base In the s real time strategy games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean internet caf s with crucial influence on the development of esports worldwide Competitions exist for many titles and genres though the most popular games as of the early s are Counter Strike Global Offensive Call of Duty League of Legends Dota Fortnite Rocket League Valorant Hearthstone Super Smash Bros Melee StarCraft II and Overwatch Hearthstone has also popularized the digital collectible card game DCCG genre since its release in Video game design While it is common for video games to be designed with the experience of the player in game being the only priority many successful esports games have been designed to be played professionally from the beginning Developers may decide to add dedicated esports features or even make design compromises to support high level competition Games such as StarCraft II League of Legends and Dota have all been designed at least in part to support professional competition Spectator mode In addition to allowing players to participate in a given game many game developers have added dedicated observing features for the benefit of spectators This can range from simply allowing players to watch the game unfold from the competing player s point of view to a highly modified interface that gives spectators access to information even the players may not have The state of the game viewed through this mode may tend to be delayed by a certain amount of time in order to prevent either teams in a game from gaining a competitive advantage Games with these features include Counter Strike Global Offensive Call of Duty StarCraft II Dota and Counter Strike League of Legends includes spectator features which are restricted to custom game modes In response to the release of virtual reality headsets in some games such as Dota were updated to include virtual reality spectating support Online A very common method for connection is the Internet Game servers are often separated by region but high quality connections allow players to set up real time connections across the world Downsides to online connections include increased difficulty detecting cheating compared to physical events and greater network latency which can negatively impact players performance especially at high levels of competition Many competitions take place online especially for smaller tournaments and exhibition games Since the s professional teams or organized clans have set up matches via Internet Relay Chat networks such as QuakeNet As esports have developed it has also become common for players to use automated matchmaking clients built into the games themselves This was popularized by the release of Blizzard s Battle net which has been integrated into both the Warcraft and StarCraft series Automated matchmaking has become commonplace in console gaming as well with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network After competitors have contacted each other the game is often managed by a game server either remotely to each of the competitors or running on one of the competitor s machines Local area network Additionally competitions are also often conducted over a local area network or LAN The smaller network usually has very little lag and higher quality Because competitors must be physically present LANs help ensure fair play by allowing direct scrutiny of competitors This helps prevent many forms of cheating such as unauthorized hardware or software modding The physical presence of competitors helps create a more social atmosphere at LAN events Many gamers organize LAN parties or visit Internet caf s and most major tournaments are conducted over LANs Individual games have taken various approaches to LAN support In contrast to the original StarCraft StarCraft II was released without support for LAN play drawing some strongly negative reactions from players League of Legends was originally released for online play only but announced in October that a LAN client was in the works for use in major tournaments In September Valve added general support for LAN play to Dota in a patch for the game Players and teams General players and teams Professional gamers are often associated with esports teams or broader gaming and entertainment organizations Teams such as FaZe Clan Cloud Fnatic T G Esports and Natus Vincere have become successful within esports and now sponsor esports players around the world These teams often cover multiple esports games within tournaments and leagues with various team makeups for each game They may also represent single players for one on one esports games like fighting games within Evolution Championship Series or Hearthstone tournaments In addition to prize money from tournament wins players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware Prominent esports sponsors include companies such as Logitech and Razer Teams feature these sponsors on their website team jerseys and on their social media in the biggest teams have social media followings of over a million Associations include the Korean e Sports Association KeSPA the International e Sports Federation IeSF the British esports Association and the World esports Association WESA Some traditional sporting athletes have invested in esports such as Rick Fox s ownership of Echo Fox Jeremy Lin s ownership of Team VGJ and Shaquille O Neal s investment in NRG Esports Some association football teams such as FC Schalke in Germany Paris Saint Germain esports in France Besiktas JK Fenerbahce S K and Galatasaray in Turkey Panathinaikos F C in Greece either sponsor or have complete ownership in esports teams Competitive Esports tournaments in the most popular games pay hundreds to thousands of dollars to players for winning tournaments Dota s tournament The International had a prize pool over million and is projected to keep growing Counter Strike Global Offensive had a prize pool of around million However financial security in the industry is largely limited to players in top performing teams One study found that only in professional gamers have careers that last longer than two years Team rosters are extremely volatile sometimes changing players or rosters within a season While different from the regimens of traditional sports esports athletes still have extensive training routines Team Liquid a professional League of Legends team practice for a minimum of hours per week and most play the game far more In April researchers from the Queensland University of Technology found that some of the top esports players showed similar aspects of mental toughness as Olympic athletes This training schedule for players has resulted in many of them retiring an early age Players are generally in competition by their mid to late teens with most retiring by their late s Unique players and teams There is a long history of different esports teams or certain players in leagues that aren t exactly the same as most players For example there are many esports organizations or teams that are entirely made up of players that have physical disabilities Permastunned and ParaEsports are great examples of this where ParaEsports is completely composed of professional CSGO players that have cerebral palsy Whilst these teams aren t in many cases very successful in the major leagues of their respective esports there are certain leagues or tournaments that are restricted to only have teams or players like these be able to compete Although these teams or tournaments don t get nearly as much attention budget or prize pool as the main leagues of popular esports it is still important to recognize these amazing players that have overcome their unfortunate positions and strive to succeed Leagues and tournaments Promotion and relegation leagues In most team based esports organized play is centered around the use of promotion and relegation to move sponsored teams between leagues within the competition s organization based on how the team fared in matches this follows patterns of professional sports in European and Asian countries Teams will play a number of games across a season as to vie for top positioning in the league by the end of that season Those that do well in addition to prize money may be promoted into a higher level league while those that fare poorly can be regulated downward For example until Riot Games ran several League of Legends series with the League of Legends Championship Series being the top tier series Teams that did not do well were relegated to the League of Legends Challenger Series replaced by the better performing teams from that series This format was discontinued when Riot opted to use the franchise format in mid but the promotion and relegation format still exists within Southeast Asia s Pacific Championship Series and in North America s new tier league the North American Challengers Series as of Franchised leagues With rising interest in viewership of esports some companies sought to create leagues that followed the franchise approach used in North American professional sports in which all teams backed by a major financial sponsor to support the franchise participate in a regular season of matches to vie for top standing as to participate in the post season games This approach is more attractive for larger investors who would be more willing to back a team that remains playing in the esport s premiere league and not threatened to be relegated to a lower standing Though the details vary from league to league these leagues generally require all signed player to have a minimum salary with appropriate benefits and may share in the team s winnings While there is no team promotion or relegation players can be signed onto contracts traded among teams or let go as free agents and new players may be pulled from the esports equivalent minor league The first such league to be formed was the Overwatch League established by Blizzard Entertainment in based on its Overwatch game Initially launched in with teams the league expanded to twenty teams in Though the first two seasons were played at Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles the Overwatch League s third season in will implement the typical home away game format at esports arenas in the teams various home cities or regions The OWL would fold in and would be replaced by a more open esports structure for Overwatch known as the Overwatch Champions Series Take Two Interactive partnered with the National Basketball Association NBA to create the NBA K League using the NBA K game series It is the first esports league to be operated by a professional sports league and the NBA sought to have a League team partially sponsored by each of the professional NBA teams Its inaugural season started in May with teams and the league has since expanded to teams including teams owned by Gen G and Australia s National Basketball League Similar to the NBA K League EA Sports and Major League Soccer MLS established the eMLS in a league using EA s FIFA Now known as EA Sports FC series EA would later establish esports leagues with other professional football leagues ranging from the English Premier League to the Saudi Pro League which would feed into qualification for the FIFAe World Cup and later the EA Sports FC Pro World Championship Activision launched its team Call of Duty League in January following the format of the Overwatch League but based on the Call of Duty series Cloud and Dignitas among others developed a franchise based Counter Strike Global Offensive league Flashpoint in February This was the first such esports league to be owned by the teams rather than any single organization Due to the COVID pandemic and other complications Flashpoint would be discontinued by Tournaments Esports are also frequently played in tournaments where potential players and teams vie to be placed through qualification matches before entering the tournament From there the tournament formats can vary from single or double elimination sometimes hybridized with group stage Esports tournaments are almost always physical events in which occur in front of a live audience with referees or officials to monitor for cheating The tournament may be part of a larger gathering such as Dreamhack or the competition may be the entirety of the event like the World Cyber Games or the Fortnite World Cup Esports competitions have also become a popular feature at gaming and multi genre conventions Although competitions involving video games have long existed esports underwent a significant transition in the late s Beginning with the Cyberathlete Professional League in tournaments became much larger and corporate sponsorship became more common Increasing viewership both in person and online brought esports to a wider audience Major tournaments include the World Cyber Games the North American Major League Gaming league the France based Electronic Sports World Cup and the World e Sports Games held in Hangzhou China The average compensation for professional esports players does not compare to those of the top classical sports organizations in the world According to Julian Krinsky Camps Programs website the top Esports player in the world earned around million in The highest overall salary by any esports professional at the time was around million While prizes for esports competitions can be very large the limited number of competitions and large number of competitors ultimately lowers the amount of money one can make in the industry In the United States Esports competitions have prizes that can reach for a single victory Dota International hosted a competition where the grand prize winning team walked home with almost million For well established games total prize money can amount to millions of U S dollars a year As of September Dota has awarded approximately US million in prize money within registered tournaments with players winning over million League of Legends awarded approximately million within registered tournaments but in addition to the prize money Riot Games provides salaries for players within their League of Legends Championship Series Nonetheless there has been criticism to how these salaries are distributed since most players earn a fairly low wage but a few top players have a significantly higher salary skewing the average earning per player In August The International Valve s annual premier Dota tournament was held and broke the record for holding the largest prize pool to date for any esports tournament amounting to over US million Often game developers provide prize money for tournament competition directly but sponsorship may also come from third parties typically companies selling computer hardware energy drinks or computer software Generally hosting a large esports event is not profitable as a stand alone venture For example Riot has stated that their headline League of Legends Championship Series is a significant investment that we re not making money from There is considerable variation and negotiation over the relationship between video game developers and tournament organizers and broadcasters While the original StarCraft events emerged in South Korea largely independently of Blizzard the company decided to require organizers and broadcasters to authorize events featuring the sequel StarCraft II In the short term this led to a deadlock with the Korean e Sports Association An agreement was reached in Blizzard requires authorization for tournaments with more than US in prizes Riot Games offers in game rewards to authorized tournaments Collegiate and school leagues In addition to professional and amateur esports esports have drawn attention of colleges and high schools since Along with the bursting popularity of esports over the last two decades came a demand for extended opportunities for esports athletes Universities across the world mostly China and America began offering scholarship opportunities to incoming freshmen to join their collegiate esports teams According to Schaeperkoetter and others the potential impact that an esports program could have on a university coupled with the growing interest that universities are showing in such a program combine to make this line of research relevant in sport literature As of over colleges have esports based variety programs Governing bodies While game publishers or esports broadcasters typically act in oversight roles for specific esports a number of esports governing bodies have been established to collectively represent esports on a national regional or global basis These governing bodies may have various levels of involvement with the esport from being part of esports regulation to simply acting more as a trade group and public face for esports The International Esports Federation IESF was one of the first such bodies Originally formed in to help promote esports in the Southeast Asian region it has grown to include over member countries from across the globe The IESF has managed annual World Esports Championships for teams from its member countries across multiple games The European Esports Federation was formed in April and includes UK Belgium Germany Austria Hungary France Russia Slovenia Serbia Sweden Turkey and Ukraine This body was designed more to be a managing partner for other esports working to coordinate event structures and regulations across multiple esports Additionally trade groups representing video games have also generally acted as governing bodies for esports Notably in November five major national trade organizations the Entertainment Software Association in the United States the Entertainment Software Association of Canada The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment Interactive Software Federation of Europe and the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association of Australian and New Zealand issued a joined statement for supporting the promotion and participation of esports to respect player safety and integrity respect and diversity among players and enriching game play Criticisms and legal problems Health concerns Most esports generally require participants to sit and or move little while playing which raises concerns about a sedentary lifestyle by players A research led by Ingo Frob se a professor at the German Sports University in Cologne for over eight years found professional and also amateur esports gamers play on average hours per week and even physical activities after hours of playing are not able to compensate the damage of oversitting Players in China may train for almost hours a day A study conducted in of CS GO players found that total hours played were about
