id: 53963474
A battle royale game is an online multiplayer video game genre that blends last man standing gameplay with the survival exploration and scavenging elements of a survival game Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside a shrinking safe area with the winner being the last player or team alive The name for the genre is taken from the Japanese film Battle Royale itself based on the novel of the same name which presents a similar theme of a last man standing competition in a shrinking play zone The genre s origins arose from mods for large scale online survival games like Minecraft and ARMA in the early s By the end of the decade the genre became a cultural phenomenon with standalone games such as PUBG Battlegrounds Fortnite Battle Royale Apex Legends and Call of Duty Warzone each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases Concept Battle royale games are played between many individual players pairs of players or a number of small squads typically of players In each match the goal is to be the last player or team standing by eliminating all other opponents A match starts by placing the player characters into a large map space typically by having all players skydive from a large aircraft within a brief time limit The map may have random distribution or allow players to have some control of where they start All players start with minimal equipment giving no player an implicit advantage at the onset Equipment usually used for combat survival or transport is randomly scattered around the map often at landmarks on the map such as within buildings in ghost towns Players need to search the map for these items while avoiding being killed by other players who cannot be visually marked or distinguishable either on screen or on the map requiring the player to solely use their own eyes and ears to deduce their positions Equipment from eliminated players can usually be looted as well These games often include some mechanic to push opponents closer together as the game progresses usually taking the form of a gradually shrinking safe zone with players outside the zone facing elimination Typically battle royale contestants are only given one life and any players who die are rarely allowed to respawn Games with team support may allow players to enter a temporary not permanent near death state once health is depleted giving allies the opportunity to revive them before they give out or are finished off by an opponent The match is over when only one player or team remains and the game typically provides some type of reward such as in game currency used for cosmetic items to all players based on how long they survived The random nature of starting point item placement and safe area reduction enables the battle royale genre to challenge players to think and react quickly and improve strategies throughout the match as to be the last man team standing In addition to standalone games the battle royale concept may also be present as part of one of many game modes within a larger game or may be applied as a user created mod created for another game There are various modifications that can be implemented atop the fundamentals of the battle royale For example Fortnite introduced a temporary mode in an event which is versus player mode in its Fortnite Battle Royale free to play game players are assigned one of the two teams and work with their teammates to collect resources and weapons towards constructing fortifications as the safe area of the game shrinks down with the goal to eliminate all the players on the other team History Formulative elements of the battle royale genre had existed prior to the s Gameplay modes featuring last man standing rules has been a frequent staple of multiplayer online action games though generally with fewer total players as early as s Bomberman which introduced multiplayer game modes with players all starting with the same minimal abilities who collected power ups and fought until the last player was left standing The elements of scavenging and surviving on a large open world map were popularized through survival games The Japanese film Battle Royale along with Koushun Takami s earlier novel of the same name and its manga adaptation set out the basic rules of the genre including players being forced to kill each other until there is a single survivor taking place on a shrinking map and the need to scavenge for weapons and items It soon inspired a wave of battle royale themed Japanese manga and anime such as Gantz Future Diary and Btooom and then the battle royale formula eventually appeared in The Hunger Games franchise Fictional battle royale video games were depicted in Btooom and in the Phantom Bullet Gun Gale Online arc of the light novel series Sword Art Online in print as the Bullet of Bullets tournament Initial attempts at adapting the Battle Royale formula into video games came in the form of Japanese visual novel games that focused on storytelling and puzzle solving such as Higurashi When They Cry Zero Escape and Danganronpa However these visual novel games are distinct from the genre which became known as battle royale games which emerged when Western developers later adapted the Battle Royale formula into a shooter game format Early mods and games Shortly after the release of the film The Hunger Games which had a similar premise to the earlier film Battle Royale a server plug in named Hunger Games later changed to Survival Games was developed for Minecraft Survival Games takes inspiration from the film initially placing players at the center of the map near a set of equipment chests When the game commences players can compete over the central resources or spread out to find items stored in chests scattered around the play area Players killed are eliminated and the last surviving player wins the match In DayZ a mod for Arma released in August players struggle alongside or against each other to obtain basic necessities to continue living in a persistent sandbox filled with various dangers The mod was designed to include player versus player encounters but generally these events were infrequent due to the size of the game s map and the persistence of the game world This led to the development of game mods that sacrificed DayZ open endedness in favor of focusing on more frequent hostile interactions between players to determine an eventual winner The most influential battle royale mod was created by Brendan Greene known by his online alias PlayerUnknown whose Battle Royale mod of DayZ first released in This mod was directly inspired by Battle Royale and introduces concepts from the film such as a shrinking play zone that forces players into closer proximity as the game goes on In contrast to Hunger Games inspired mods in Greene s mod weapons were randomly scattered around the map Greene recreated this mod for Arma in Greene continued to use his format as a consultant for H Z King of the Kill before becoming the creative developer at Bluehole of a standalone game representing his vision of the battle royale genre which would later be released as PUBG Battlegrounds Games from other developers took inspiration from highly played battle royale style mods as well as the popularity of The Hunger Games film series Ark Survival Evolved by Studio Wildcard introduced its Survival of the Fittest mode in July which was geared to be used for esports tournaments The mode was temporarily broken off as its own free to play game during before the developers opted to merge it back into the main game for ease of maintenance of the overall game In a battle royale mobile game Btooom Online based on the manga Btooom was developed and released in Japan Despite some initial success on the Japanese mobile charts Btooom Online was ultimately a commercial failure in Japan Formation of standalone games While formative elements of the battle royale genre had been established before the genre grew from two principal titles through and PUBG Battlegrounds which soon inspired Fortnite Battle Royale Both games drew tens of millions of players in short periods of time proving them as commercial successes and leading to future growth after H Z King of the Kill which predated these two titles in the genre had become a fixture in the top most played games on Steam by the start of but was not able to maintain its playerbase PUBG Battlegrounds was created by Brendan Greene its title based on his online alias PlayerUnknown The game was based on his previous Battle Royale mod for ARMA and DayZ first released in Building on his earlier work Greene went to work at Bluehole in South Korea becoming the creative developer of a standalone game representing his vision of the battle royale genre PUBG Battlegrounds While Battlegrounds was not the first battle royale game its release to early access in March drew a great deal of attention selling over twenty million copies by the end of the year and is considered the defining game of the genre In September the game broke the previous record for highest number of concurrent players on Steam with over million users playing the game simultaneously Battlegrounds explosive growth and how it established the battle royale genre was considered one of the top trends in the video game industry in Battlegrounds popularity created a new interest in the battle royale genre Numerous games that copied the fundamental gameplay of Battlegrounds appeared in China shortly after Battlegrounds release Epic Games had released Fortnite a cooperative survival game into early access near the release of Battlegrounds Epic saw the potential to create their own battle royale mode and by September released the free to play Fortnite Battle Royale which combined some of the survival elements and mechanics from the main Fortnite game with the Battle Royale gameplay concept The game saw similar player counts as Battlegrounds with twenty million unique players reported by Epic Games by November Bluehole expressed concern at this move less due to being a clone of Battlegrounds but more so that they had been working with Epic Games for technical support of the Unreal Engine in Battlegrounds and thus they were worried that Fortnite may be able to include planned features to their battle royale mode before they could release those in Battlegrounds Battleground s developer PUBG Corporation filed a lawsuit against Epic in South Korea in January claiming Fortnite Battle Royale infringements on Battlegrounds copyrights Market observers predicted that there would be little likelihood of Bluehole winning the case as it would be difficult to establish the originality of PUBG in court due to itself being derived from Battle Royale By the end of June the lawsuit had been closed by PUBG under undisclosed reasons In Fortnite Battle Royale rivaled Battlegrounds in player numbers and surpassed it in revenue which was attributed to its free to play business model and cross platform support as well as its accessibility to casual players Battlegrounds creator Brendan Greene credited it with further growing the battle royale genre Its mainstream publicity further
