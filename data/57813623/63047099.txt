season The game had seasons from its release in to but on June it was reset to Season After that it went on to have more seasons before August where it was announced that Seasons would be phased out in favor of more frequent updates As Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout As Fall Guys Post Seasons updates Development The conception of what became Fall Guys began when Mediatonic was discussing another project in January Lead designer Joe Walsh said that it reminded him of game shows such as Takeshi s Castle and Total Wipeout He drew from that inspiration to create a pitch document for what would become Fall Guys Originally titled Fools Gauntlet also later under development using the name Stumble Chums Walsh s pitch featured players competing in a battle royale composed of physical challenges Creative director Jeff Tanton while initially skeptical that creating another battle royale game would be successful was quickly convinced of the game s potential and forwarded Walsh s pitch to Mediatonic s founders Tanton and Walsh worked on a pitch deck and principal concept artist Dan Hoang created images featuring colourful bean shaped characters racing on an obstacle course in the sky Tanton explained that Hoang s character designs helped shift the focus of the game away from the obstacle course itself to the characters With the pitch deck completed Tanton pitched the game to different publishers at the Game Developers Conference Six months after Devolver Digital agreed to publish the game development began Fall Guys began its initial prototyping process with a small team growing to people during development Initial progress on individual minigames was slow which caused the team to worry that there would not be enough content for launch A turning point came when the team made a group of pillars that Took the opinions of people out of the occasion and allowed the developers to kill ideas faster Such pillars include ensuring a minigame was chaos and skill and that a level had to be different every time Inspired by game shows and differentiating from first person shooter battle royale games Mediatonic focused on gameplay variety By presenting the player with several randomized rounds of game modes Mediatonic hoped to recreate the experience of being on a game show To help keep the spirit of playground games and game shows Mediatonic created an internal rule that game modes needed to be explained in three words Over time the game underwent numerous other changes The player count was decreased from to because overpopulated games stopped being readable or fun In testing Mediatonic noted that players overestimated the number of players stating we didn t need as many players as we thought to create the crowds we wanted the gameplay to include It s a Knockout a game show forcing contestants to dress up in oversized costumes inspired the idea that the characters should have that element of being completely uniquely badly designed for the task that we were gonna put them through The ragdoll physics is deliberate to avoid hyper athletic Ninja Warrior characters and because falling over is funny According to Walsh striking the right balance between funny ragdoll collisions and game performance was critical because as soon as you lose the ragdoll ness of the character you lose the comedy The character designs were inspired by the look of vinyl toys Mediatonic began working on Season before the game s release with level designer Joseph Juson noting that it was more of an expansion compared to Season where the team tried to bring new ideas Release Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout was announced at E in June and was released on August for PlayStation and Windows Several updates ensued for the first season and on October the medieval themed second season was released The success prompted more hiring The Chinese company Bilibili announced in August that it would develop a mobile version for Android and iOS that would be exclusive to China The deal expired in and Fall Guys announced that their exclusive content and accounts on Bilibili would be run by Epic from now on In February Fall Guys was announced for Nintendo Switch Xbox One and Xbox Series X scheduled for Summer However in April these versions of the game were delayed to late citing greater focus on cross compatibility among all versions of the game On November the release was delayed again to In March Mediatonic and its parent company Tonic Games Group were bought by Epic Games Epic Games later announced that they will focus on adding cross platform compatibility for all versions of Fall Guys utilizing resources from games such as Fortnite that became available after acquisition by Epic Games On November Mediatonic announced that Epic Games accounts will be required in season allowing cross platform progression between PS and Steam and the ability to have custom names for Steam players On February Mediatonic released an update adding Lobbies and Friends lists This uses the Epic Overlay system that games like Fortnite or Rocket League have to invite anyone on any platform via Epic Games Accounts On March Mediatonic announced that starting on April there would be a new launcher that all PlayStation players would need to download to keep playing the game On May the old PlayStation launcher shut down and became unusable Both launchers were the same besides the new one being published by Epic Games instead of Devolver Digital People who downloaded the new launcher would be able to redeem a free DLC Pink Shark costume that was able to be redeemed until the end of season Mediatonic and Epic Games transitioned Fall Guys to a free to play system alongside its June release on Xbox One Xbox Series X S and Nintendo Switch Additionally a dedicated PlayStation version also released featuring enhanced visuals and DualSense effects The game was also rebranded as Fall Guys without the Ultimate Knockout subtitle The free to play version eliminated the need for players to have console subscription services like PlayStation Plus to be able to play To support the free to play model the game included a new season pass system with both a free and premium tier of rewards the latter available to those that purchase the premium pass with real world funds For Windows the game was removed from the Steam storefront and made available on Epic Games Store though the Steam version will continue to be updated in sync with the Epic Games Store version The free to play versions of Fall Guys also added support for cross platform play with other platforms Players who had purchased Fall Guys before this transition were given a Legacy Pack that includes cosmetics costumes and the Season Free for All premium season pass for free In July a bug was discovered that unintentionally purchased items from the in game store instead of previewing them Initially deemed by Mediatonic as not an issue they later acknowledged it as a bug after complaints mounted On November an update was issued to include a hold to purchase mechanic for all in game purchases similar to the mechanic in Fortnite On October the hashtag savefallguys started trending on Twitter This was to elicit Mediatonic s attention to address and resolve numerous problems that players have had with the game including lack of round variety bugs sub par events prices in the in game shop implementation of skill based matchmaking and more On November the Fall Guys Twitter account stated that in order for the game to stay stable some rounds will be vaulted and rounds will be rotated in and out of the vault This meant that some rounds will be temporarily removed to increase stability across all platforms Players criticised this move citing how removing pre existing rounds causes the game to lose its replay value Starting with the Fall Forever update the vault was discontinued with rounds being cycled through the Knockout show consistently regardless of it s vaulted status On February Mediatonic announced in a blogpost that Seasons will be longer than months for future seasons to allow for more time to work on future seasons They also limited Solo Show from players to and announced a level editor which was originally teased in called Creative Creative launched on May Since Season Sunken Secrets Jukio Kallio no longer composes the game s music On July Fall Guys show bucks prices were increased in the United Kingdom Mexico and Canada due to inflation On September Fall Guys announced that the price for show bucks would also be increasing in Czech Republic Denmark Eurozone countries Hungary Japan Norway Poland Romania Sweden Turkey and the United States for similar reasons On August it was announced that Seasons would be phased out in favor of more frequent updates Fame Passes will remain however Tim Sweeney has said that Fall Guys and Rocket League will not be discontinued despite mass layoffs and Epic will continue to invest in them Reception Fall Guys received generally favourable reviews according to review aggregator website Metacritic A clone game called Stumble Guys was released for mobile devices in and became popular Tom Wiggins of Stuff magazine praised the game calling it Super Monkey Ball for the Fortnite generation Mercury News praised the controlled chaos gameplay of Fall Guys stating it to be utilising a combination of the elements from the battle royale game Fortnite and the party game Mario Party in such a way that made it tailored to the coronavirus age Ollie Toms from Rock Paper Shotgun praised Fall Guys for its creative approach as a battle royale game incorporating family friendly elements rather than resorting to violent themes He praised the simplicity of the game and the diversity of content added with each season He argues that the ragdoll physics can be both exciting and frustrating to play What really makes and breaks this game is the imprecision of your actions It s not something many competitive games can get away with in the way Fall Guys does The weekend before release during a closed beta Fall Guys briefly became the most watched game on Twitch as well as the sixth best selling Steam game where it was available for pre order Fall Guys has been frequently compared to Among Us in that both are online games which grew in popularity during the COVID
