The Guardian is a British daily newspaper It was founded in as The Manchester Guardian before it changed its name in Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group owned by the Scott Trust Limited The trust was created in to secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference The trust was converted into a limited company in with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators Profits are reinvested in its journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK The editor in chief Katharine Viner succeeded Alan Rusbridger in Since the paper s main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format As of July its print edition had a daily circulation of The newspaper has an online edition TheGuardian com as well as three international websites Guardian Australia founded in Guardian New Zealand founded in and Guardian US founded in The paper s readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion and the term Guardian reader is used to imply a stereotype of a person with liberal left wing or politically correct views Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the Grauniad in the s a nickname still occasionally used by the editors for self mockery In an Ipsos MORI research poll in September designed to interrogate the public s trust of specific titles online The Guardian scored highest for digital content news with of readers agreeing that they trust what they see in it A December report of a poll by the Publishers Audience Measurement Company stated that the paper s print edition was found to be the most trusted in the UK in the period from October to September It was also reported to be the most read of the UK s quality newsbrands including digital editions other quality brands included The Times The Daily Telegraph The Independent and the i While The Guardian s print circulation is in decline the report indicated that news from The Guardian including that reported online reaches more than million UK adults each month Chief among the notable scoops obtained by the paper was the News International phone hacking scandal and in particular the hacking of the murdered English teenager Milly Dowler s phone The investigation led to the closure of the News of the World the UK s best selling Sunday newspaper and one of the highest circulation newspapers in history In June The Guardian broke news of the secret collection by the Obama administration of Verizon telephone records and subsequently revealed the existence of the surveillance program PRISM after knowledge of it was leaked to the paper by the whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden In The Guardian led an investigation into the Panama Papers exposing then Prime Minister David Cameron s links to offshore bank accounts It has been named newspaper of the year four times at the annual British Press Awards most recently in for its reporting on government surveillance History to Early years The Manchester Guardian was founded in Manchester in by cotton merchant John Edward Taylor with backing from the Little Circle a group of non conformist businessmen They launched the paper on May by chance the very day of Napoleon s death after the police closure of the more radical Manchester Observer a paper that had championed the cause of the Peterloo Massacre protesters Taylor had been hostile to the radical reformers writing They have appealed not to the reason but the passions and the suffering of their abused and credulous fellow countrymen from whose ill requited industry they extort for themselves the means of a plentiful and comfortable existence They do not toil neither do they spin but they live better than those that do When the government closed down the Manchester Observer the mill owners champions had the upper hand The influential journalist Jeremiah Garnett joined Taylor during the establishment of the paper and all of the Little Circle wrote articles for the new paper The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that it would zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty warmly advocate the cause of Reform endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy and support without reference to the party from which they emanate all serviceable measures In the paper merged with the British Volunteer and was known as The Manchester Guardian and British Volunteer until The working class Manchester and Salford Advertiser called The Manchester Guardian the foul prostitute and dirty parasite of the worst portion of the mill owners The Manchester Guardian was generally hostile to labour s claims Of the Ten Hours Bill the paper doubted whether in view of the foreign competition the passing of a law positively enacting a gradual destruction of the cotton manufacture in this kingdom would be a much less rational procedure The Manchester Guardian dismissed strikes as the work of outside agitators stating that if an accommodation can be effected the occupation of the agents of the Union is gone They live on strife In March an academic review commissioned by the Scott Trust determined that John Edward Taylor and nine of his eleven backers had links to the Atlantic slave trade through their interests in Manchester s textile industry Slavery and the American Civil War The newspaper opposed slavery and supported free trade An leading article on the continuing cruelty and injustice to slaves in the West Indies long after the abolition of the slave trade with the Slave Trade Act wanted fairness to the interests and claims both of the planters and of their oppressed slaves It welcomed the Slavery Abolition Act and accepted the increased compensation to the planters as the guilt of slavery attaches far more to the nation rather than individuals Success of the Act would encourage emancipation in other slave owning nations to avoid imminent risk of a violent and bloody termination However the newspaper argued against restricting trade with countries that had not yet abolished slavery Complex tensions developed in the United States When the abolitionist George Thompson toured the newspaper said that s lavery is a monstrous evil but civil war is not a less one and we would not seek the abolition even of the former through the imminent hazard of the latter It suggested that the United States should compensate slave owners for freeing slaves and called on President Franklin Pierce to resolve the civil war the Sacking of Lawrence due to pro slavery laws imposed by Congress In The Observer quoted a report that the newly elected president Abraham Lincoln was opposed to abolition of slavery On May shortly after the start of the American Civil War the Manchester Guardian portrayed the Northern states as primarily imposing a burdensome trade monopoly on the Confederate States arguing that if the South was freed to have direct trade with Europe the day would not be distant when slavery itself would cease Therefore the newspaper asked Why should the South be prevented from freeing itself from slavery This hopeful view was also held by the Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone There was division in Britain over the Civil War even within political parties The Manchester Guardian had also been conflicted It had supported other independence movements and felt it should also support the rights of the Confederacy to self determination It criticised Lincoln s Emancipation Proclamation for not freeing all American slaves On October it wrote It is impossible to cast any reflections upon a man so evidently sincere and well intentioned as Mr Lincoln but it is also impossible not to feel that it was an evil day both for America and the world when he was chosen President of the United States By then the Union blockade was causing suffering in British towns Some including Liverpool supported the Confederacy as did current opinion in all classes in London On December cotton workers held a meeting at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester which resolved its detestation of negro slavery in America and of the attempt of the rebellious Southern slave holders to organise on the great American continent a nation having slavery as its basis There was a comment that an effort had been made in a leading article of the Manchester Guardian to deter the working men from assembling together for such a purpose The newspaper reported all this and published their letter to President Lincoln while complaining that the chief occupation if not the chief object of the meeting seems to have been to abuse the Manchester Guardian Lincoln replied to the letter thanking the workers for their sublime Christian heroism and American ships delivered relief supplies to Britain The newspaper reported the shock to the community of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in concluding that t he parting of his family with the dying President is too sad for description but in what from today s perspective looks an ill judged editorial wrote that o f his rule we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty adding it is doubtless to be regretted that he had not the opportunity of vindicating his good intentions According to Martin Kettle writing for The Guardian in February The Guardian had always hated slavery But it doubted the Union hated slavery to the same degree It argued that the Union had always tacitly condoned slavery by shielding the southern slave states from the condemnation they deserved It was critical of Lincoln s emancipation proclamation for stopping short of a full repudiation of slavery throughout the US And it chastised the president for being so willing to negotiate with the south with slavery one of the issues still on the table C P Scott C P Scott made the newspaper nationally recognised He was editor for years from and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor s son in Under Scott the paper s moderate editorial line became more radical supporting William Gladstone when the Liberals split in and opposing the Second Boer War against popular opinion Scott supported the movement for women s suffrage but was critical of any tactics by the Suffragettes that involved direct action The really ludicrous position is that Mr Lloyd George is fighting to enfranchise seven million women and the militants are smashing unoffending people s windows and breaking up benevolent societies meetings in a desperate effort to prevent him Scott thought the Suffragettes courage and devotion was worthy of a better cause and saner leadership It has been argued that Scott s criticism reflected a widespread disdain at the time for those women who transgressed the gender expectations of Edwardian society Scott commissioned J M Synge and his friend Jack Yeats to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of Ireland these pieces were published in in the collection Travels in Wicklow West Kerry and Connemara Scott s friendship with Chaim Weizmann played a role in the Balfour Declaration In The Manchester Guardian was a supporter of the new State of Israel Ownership of the paper passed in June to the Scott Trust named after the last owner John Russell Scott who was the first chairman of the Trust This move ensured the paper s independence From to a special archival copy of all the daily newspapers was preserved in zinc cases These were found in whilst the newspaper s archives were deposited at the University of Manchester s John Rylands University Library on the Oxford Road campus The first case was opened and found to contain the newspapers issued in August in pristine condition The zinc cases had been made each month by the newspaper s plumber and stored for posterity The other cases were not opened and were all returned to storage at The Guardian s garage owing to shortage of space at the library Spanish Civil War Traditionally affiliated with the centrist to centre left Liberal Party and with a northern non conformist circulation base the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the Spanish Civil War George Orwell wrote in Homage to Catalonia Of our larger papers the Manchester Guardian is the only one that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty With the pro Liberal News Chronicle the Labour supporting Daily Herald the Communist Party s Daily Worker and several Sunday and weekly papers it supported the Republican government against General Francisco Franco s insurgent nationalists Post war The paper s then editor A P Wadsworth so loathed Labour s left wing champion Aneurin Bevan who had made a reference to getting rid of Tory Vermin in a speech and the hate gospellers of his entourage that it encouraged readers to vote Conservative in the general election and remove Clement Attlee s post war Labour government The Manchester Guardian strongly opposed military intervention during the Suez Crisis The Anglo French ultimatum to Egypt is an act of folly without justification in any terms but brief expediency It pours petrol on a growing fire There is no knowing what kind of explosion will follow On August The Manchester Guardian changed its name to The Guardian This change reflected the growing prominence of national and international affairs in the newspaper In September The Guardian which had previously only been published in Manchester began to be printed in London Nesta Roberts was appointed as the newspaper s first news editor there becoming the first woman to hold such a position on a British national newspaper to The Troubles During the early period of the Troubles The Guardian supported British state intervention to quell disturbances between Irish Catholics and Ulster loyalists in Northern Ireland After the Battle of the Bogside between Catholic residents of Derry and the Royal Ulster Constabulary RUC The Guardian called for the British Armed Forces to be deployed to the region arguing that their deployment would present a more disinterested face of law and order than the RUC On January troops from the st Battalion Parachute Regiment opened fire on a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march killing fourteen people in an event that would come to be known as Bloody Sunday In response to the incident The Guardian argued that Neither side can escape condemnation The organizers of the demonstration Miss Bernadette Devlin among them deliberately challenged the ban on marches They knew that stone throwing and sniping could not be prevented and that the IRA might use the crowd as a shield The Guardian further stated that It is certainly true that the army cordons had endured a wanton barrage of stones steel bars and other missiles That still does not justify opening fire so freely After the events of Bloody Sunday John Widgery Baron Widgery was appointed the head of a tribunal to investigate the killings The resulting tribunal known as the Widgery Tribunal largely exonerated the actions of the soldiers involved in the incident The Guardian published an article on April which supported the tribunal and its findings arguing that Widgery s report is not one sided In response to the introduction of internment without trial in Northern Ireland The Guardian argued that Internment without trial is hateful repressive and undemocratic In the existing Irish situation most regrettably it is also inevitable To remove the ringleaders in the hope that the atmosphere might calm down is a step to which there is no obvious alternative Sarah Tisdall In the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of cruise missiles in Britain that were leaked to The Guardian by civil servant Sarah Tisdall The paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities which resulted in a six month prison sentence for Tisdall though she served only four I still blame myself said Peter Preston who was the editor of The Guardian at the time but he went on to argue that the paper had no choice because it believed in the rule of law In a article discussing Julian Assange and the protection of sources by journalists John Pilger criticised the editor of The Guardian for betraying Tisdall by choosing not to go to prison on a fundamental principle of protecting a source Alleged penetration by Russian intelligence In KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky identified Guardian literary editor Richard Gott as an agent of influence While Gott denied that he received cash he admitted he had had lunch at the Soviet Embassy and had taken benefits from the KGB on overseas visits Gott resigned from his post Gordievsky commented on the newspaper The KGB loved The Guardian It was deemed highly susceptible to penetration Jonathan Aitken In both the Granada Television programme World in Action and The Guardian were sued for libel by the then cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken for their allegation that Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed had paid for Aitken and his wife to stay at the H tel Ritz in Paris which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on Aitken s part Aitken publicly stated that he would fight with the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play The court case proceeded and in The Guardian produced evidence that Aitken s claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue In Aitken was jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice Connection In May a series of Guardian investigations exposed the wholesale fabrication of a much garlanded ITV documentary The Connection produced by Carlton Television The documentary purported to film an undiscovered route by which heroin was smuggled into the United Kingdom from Colombia An internal inquiry at Carlton found that The Guardian s allegations were in large part correct and the then industry regulator the ITC punished Carlton with a record million fine for multiple breaches of the UK s broadcasting codes The scandal led to an impassioned debate about the accuracy of documentary production Later in June The Guardian revealed further fabrications in another Carlton documentary from the same director Kosovo War The paper supported NATO s military intervention in the Kosovo War in The Guardian stated that the only honourable course for Europe and America is to use military force Mary Kaldor s piece was headlined Bombs away But to save civilians we must get in some soldiers too Since In the early s The Guardian challenged the Act of Settlement and the Treason Felony Act In October The Guardian published a humorous column by Charlie Brooker in its entertainment guide the final sentence of which was viewed by some as a call for violence against U S President George W Bush after a controversy Brooker and the paper issued an apology saying the closing comments were intended as an ironic joke not as a call to action Following the July London bombings The Guardian published an article on its comment pages by Dilpazier Aslam a year old British Muslim and journalism trainee from Yorkshire Aslam was a member of Hizb ut Tahrir an Islamist group and had published a number of articles on their website According to the newspaper it did not know that Aslam was a member of Hizb ut Tahrir when he applied to become a trainee though several staff members were informed of this once he started at the paper The Home Office said that the group s ultimate aim is the establishment of an Islamic state Caliphate according to Hizb ut Tahrir via non violent means The Guardian asked Aslam to resign his membership of the group and when he did not do so terminated his employment In early The Guardian started a tax investigation into a number of major UK companies including publishing a database of the tax paid by the FTSE companies Internal documents relating to Barclays Bank s tax avoidance were removed from The Guardian website after Barclays obtained a gagging order The newspaper played a pivotal role in exposing the depth of the News of the World phone hacking affair The Economist s Intelligent Life magazine opined that As Watergate is to the Washington Post and thalidomide to the Sunday Times so phone hacking will surely be to The Guardian a defining moment in its history Israeli Palestinian conflict coverage In recent decades The Guardian has been accused of biased criticism of Israeli government policy and of bias against the Palestinians In December columnist Julie Burchill cited striking bias against the state of Israel as one of the reasons she left the paper for The Times Responding to these accusations a Guardian editorial in condemned antisemitism and defended the paper s right to criticise the policies and actions of the Israeli government arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently anti Jewish are mistaken Harriet Sherwood then The Guardian s foreign editor later its Jerusalem correspondent has also denied that The Guardian has an anti Israel bias saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the Israeli Palestinian conflict On November Chris Elliott The Guardian s readers editor wrote that Guardian reporters writers and editors must be more vigilant about the language they use when writing about Jews or Israel citing recent cases where The Guardian received complaints regarding language chosen to describe Jews or Israel Elliott noted that over nine months he upheld complaints regarding language in certain articles that were seen as anti Semitic revising the language and footnoting this change The Guardian s style guide section referred to Tel Aviv as the capital of Israel in In media watchdog HonestReporting filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission PCC after The Guardian ran a correction apologizing for wrongly having called Jerusalem as Israel s capital After an initial ruling supporting The Guardian the PCC retracted its original ruling leading to the newspaper s acknowledgement that it was wrong to call Tel Aviv Israel s capital The Guardian later clarified In the Israeli Knesset enacted a law designating the city of Jerusalem including East Jerusalem as the country s capital In response the UN security council issued resolution censuring the change in character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem and calling on all member states with diplomatic missions in the city to withdraw The UN has reaffirmed this position on several occasions and almost every country now has its embassy in Tel Aviv While it was therefore right to issue a correction to make clear Israel s designation of Jerusalem as its capital is not recognised by the international community we accept that it is wrong to state that Tel Aviv the country s financial and diplomatic centre is the capital The style guide has been amended accordingly On August the print edition of The Guardian published a pro Israeli advocacy advert during the Israel Gaza conflict featuring Elie Wiesel headed by the words Jews rejected child sacrifice years ago Now it s Hamas turn The Times had decided against running the ad although it had already appeared in major American newspapers One week later Chris Elliott expressed the opinion that the newspaper should have rejected the language used in the advert and should have negotiated with the advertiser on this matter In October The Guardian stated it would not renew the contract of cartoonist Steve Bell after he submitted a cartoon featuring Netanyahu with his shirt open wearing boxing gloves and holding a scalpel over a dotted shape of the Gaza Strip on his stomach The caption read Residents of Gaza get out now Due to what has been seen by some as a reference to Shakespeare s Shylock s pound of flesh it prompted accusations that it was antisemitic Bell said that he was inspired by the s Johnson s Scar cartoon by David Levine of U S president Lyndon B Johnson within the context of the Vietnam War Clark County In August for the US presidential election the daily G supplement launched an experimental letter writing campaign in Clark County Ohio an average sized county in a swing state Editor Ian Katz bought a voter list from the county for and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of voting against President George W Bush Katz admitted later that he did not believe Democrats who warned that the campaign would benefit Bush and not opponent John Kerry The newspaper scrapped Operation Clark County on October after first publishing a column of responses nearly all of them outraged to the campaign under the headline Dear Limey assholes Some commentators suggested that the public s dislike of the campaign contributed to Bush s victory in Clark County Guardian America and Guardian US In the paper launched Guardian America an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the United States which at the time stood at more than million The company hired former American Prospect editor New York magazine columnist and New York Review of Books writer Michael Tomasky to head the project and hire a staff of American reporters and web editors The site featured news from The Guardian that was relevant to an American audience coverage of US news and the Middle East for example Tomasky stepped down from his position as editor of Guardian America in February ceding editing and planning duties to other US and London staff He retained his position as a columnist and blogger taking the title editor at large In October the company abandoned the Guardian America homepage instead directing users to a US news index page on the main Guardian website The following month the company laid off six American employees including a reporter a multimedia producer and four web editors The move came as Guardian News and Media opted to reconsider its US strategy amid a huge effort to cut costs across the company In subsequent years however The Guardian has hired various commentators on US affairs including Ana Marie Cox Michael Wolff Naomi Wolf Glenn Greenwald and George W Bush s former speechwriter Josh Trevi o Trevi o s first blog post was an apology for a controversial tweet posted in June over the second Gaza flotilla the controversy which had been revived by the appointment Guardian US launched in September led by editor in chief Janine Gibson which replaced the previous Guardian America service After a period during which Katharine Viner served as the US editor in chief before taking charge of Guardian News and Media as a whole Viner s former deputy Lee Glendinning was appointed to succeed her as head of the American operation at the beginning of June Gagged from reporting Parliament In October The Guardian reported that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter a question recorded in a Commons order paper to be answered by a minister later that week The newspaper noted that it was being forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented for the first time in memory from reporting parliament Legal obstacles which cannot be identified involve proceedings which cannot be mentioned on behalf of a client who must remain secret The only fact The Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter Ruck The paper further claimed that this case appears to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the Bill of Rights The only parliamentary question mentioning Carter Ruck in the relevant period was by Paul Farrelly MP in reference to legal action by Barclays and Trafigura The part of the question referencing Carter Ruck relates to the latter company s September gagging order on the publication of a internal report into the C te d Ivoire toxic waste dump scandal which involved a class action case that the company only settled in September after The Guardian published some of the commodity trader s internal emails The reporting injunction was lifted the next day as Carter Ruck withdrew it before The Guardian could challenge it in the High Court Alan Rusbridger attributed the rapid back down by Carter Ruck to postings on Twitter as did a BBC News Online article Edward Snowden leaks and intervention by the UK government In June the newspaper broke news of the secret collection of Verizon telephone records held by Barack Obama s administration and subsequently revealed the existence of the PRISM surveillance program after it was leaked to the paper by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden The Guardian said a DSMA Notice had been sent to editors and journalists on June after the first Guardian story about the Snowden documents It said the DSMA Notice was being used as an attempt to censor coverage of surveillance tactics employed by intelligence agencies in the UK and US The newspaper was subsequently contacted by the British government s Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood under instruction from Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who ordered that the hard drives containing the information be destroyed The Guardian s offices were then visited in July by agents from the UK s GCHQ who supervised the destruction of the hard drives containing information acquired from Snowden The Guardian said it had destroyed the hard drives to avoid threatened legal action by the UK government that could have stopped it from reporting on US and British government surveillance contained in the documents In June The Register reported that the information the government sought to suppress by destroying the hard drives related to the location of a beyond top secret internet monitoring base in Seeb Oman and the close involvement of BT and Cable Wireless in intercepting internet communications Julian Assange criticised the newspaper for not publishing the entirety of the content when it had the chance Rusbridger had initially covered the Snowden documents without the government s supervision but subsequently sought it and established an ongoing relationship with the Defence Ministry The Guardian coverage of Snowden later continued because the information had already been copied outside the United Kingdom earning the company s US website The Guardian US an American Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in Rusbridger and subsequent chief editors would sit on the government s DSMA notice board Treatment of Julian Assange The Guardian published the US diplomatic cables files and the Guantanamo Bay files in collaboration with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks When some of the diplomatic cables were made available online in unredacted form WikiLeaks blamed Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding for publishing the encryption key to the files in their book WikiLeaks Inside Julian Assange s War on Secrecy The Guardian blamed Assange for the release of the unredacted cables Journalist Glenn Greenwald a former contributor to The Guardian accused The Guardian of publishing false claims about Assange in a report about an interview Assange gave to Italian newspaper La Repubblica The Guardian article had claimed that Assange had praised Donald Trump and criticised Hillary Clinton and also alleged that Assange had long had a close relationship with the Putin regime Greenwald wrote This article is about how those Guardian s false claims fabrications really were spread all over the internet by journalists causing hundreds of thousands of people if not millions to consume false news The Guardian later amended its article about Assange to remove the claim about his connection to the Russian government While Assange was in the Ecuadorian embassy The Guardian published a number of articles pushing the narrative that there was a link between Assange and the Russian government In a November Guardian article Luke Harding and Dan Collyns cited anonymous sources which stated that Donald Trump s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret meetings with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London in and The name of a third author Fernando Villavicencio was removed from the online version of the story soon after publication The title of the story was originally Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy A few hours after publication sources say was added to the title and the meeting became an apparent meeting One reporter characterised the story If it s right it might be the biggest get this year If it s wrong it might be the biggest gaffe Manafort and Assange both said they had never met with the latter threatening legal action against The Guardian Ecuador s London consul Fidel Narv ez who had worked at Ecuador s embassy in London from to July said that Manafort had not visited Assange Serge Halimi said Harding had a personal grievance against Assange and noted that Manafort s name does not appear in the Ecuadorian embassy s visitors book and there were no pictures of Manafort entering or leaving one of the most surveilled and filmed buildings on the planet The Guardian has neither retracted nor apologised for the story about the meeting Stella Moris Assange s wife said The Guardian failed in its responsibility to Assange and its negligence has created such a problem that if Julian dies or is extradited that will forever blot the reputation of the Guardian Priti Patel cartoon The Guardian was accused of being racist and misogynistic after it published a cartoon depicting Home Secretary Priti Patel as a cow with a ring in its nose in an alleged reference to her Hindu faith since cows are considered sacred in Hinduism Alleged WhatsApp backdoor After publishing a story on January claiming that WhatsApp had a backdoor that allows snooping on messages more than professional cryptographers signed on to an open letter calling for The Guardian to retract the article On June readers editor Paul Chadwick released an article detailing the flawed reporting in the original January article which was amended to remove references to a backdoor Spanish language edition In January The Guardian began publishing in the Spanish language under the La Lista newspaper Suella Braverman comments In October Suella Braverman speaking in Parliament blamed Guardian reading tofu eating wokerati for disruptive Just Stop Oil protests Cyber attack In December it was reported that the Guardian had suffered a significant cyber attack on its office systems thought to be ransomware Staff were directed to work from home and were able to continue publishing to the website despite the loss of some internal systems The print edition also continued to be produced On January UK staff were informed of a security breach and that the Information Commissioner s Office had been notified as required by GDPR It was indicated that staff would continue working from home until at least January The newspaper confirmed on January that personal details of all UK staff had been accessed by criminals Cyprus Confidential In November the Guardian joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Paper Trail Media and media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project OCCRP and more than journalists in countries and territories to produce the Cyprus Confidential report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin mostly with connections to Cyprus and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high up figures in the Kremlin some of whom have been sanctioned Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation s findings in less than hours calling for reforms and launching probes Ownership and finances The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group GMG of newspapers radio stations and print media GMG components include The Observer The Guardian Weekly and TheGuardian com All were owned by The Scott Trust a charitable foundation existing between and which aimed to ensure the paper s editorial independence in perpetuity maintaining its financial health to ensure it did not become vulnerable to takeovers by commercial media groups At the beginning of October the Scott Trust s assets were transferred to a new limited company The Scott Trust Limited with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up Dame Liz Forgan chair of the Scott Trust reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained the same as under the previous arrangements The Guardian is the only British national daily to conduct since an annual social ethical and environmental audit in which it examines under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor its own behaviour as a company It is also the only British national daily newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman called the readers editor to handle complaints and corrections The Guardian and its parent groups participate in Project Syndicate and intervened in to save the Mail Guardian in South Africa GMG sold the majority of its shares of the Mail Guardian in The Guardian was consistently loss making until The National Newspaper division of GMG which also includes The Observer reported operating losses of million in up from million in The paper was therefore heavily dependent on cross subsidisation from profitable companies within the group The continual losses made by the National Newspaper division of the Guardian Media Group caused it to dispose of its Regional Media division by selling titles to competitor Trinity Mirror in March This included the flagship Manchester Evening News and severed the historic link between that paper and The Guardian The sale was in order to safeguard the future of The Guardian newspaper as is the intended purpose of the Scott Trust In June Guardian News and Media revealed increased annual losses of million and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage leaving the print edition to contain more comments and features It was also speculated that The Guardian might become the first British national daily paper to be fully online For the three years up to June the paper lost a day which prompted Intelligent Life to question whether The Guardian could survive Between and The Guardian Media Group sold all their side businesses of regional papers and online portals for classifieds and consolidated into The Guardian as sole product The sales let them acquire a capital stock of million as of July supposed to guarantee the independence of the Guardian in perpetuity In the first year the paper made more losses than predicted and in January the publishers announced that The Guardian would cut per cent of staff and costs within the next three years The newspaper is rare in calling for direct contributions to deliver the independent journalism the world needs The Guardian Media Group s annual report year ending April indicated some significant changes occurring Its digital online editions accounted for over of group revenues by that time the loss from news and media operations was million lower than during the prior year million The Group had cut costs by million partly by switching its print edition to the tabloid format The Guardian Media Group s owner the Scott Trust Endowment Fund reported that its value at the time was billion billion In the following financial report for the year the group reported a profit EBITDA of million before exceptional items thus breaking even in To be sustainable the annual subsidy must fall within the million of interest returned on the investments from the Scott Trust Endowment Fund Membership subscription scheme In The Guardian launched a membership scheme The scheme aims to reduce the financial losses incurred by The Guardian without introducing a paywall thus maintaining open access to the website Website readers can pay a monthly subscription with three tiers available As of this approach was considered successful having brought more than million subscriptions or donations with the paper hoping to break even by April Foundation funding In the company established a U S based philanthropic arm to raise money from individuals and organizations including think tanks and corporate foundations The grants are focused by the donors on particular issues By the following year the organization had raised million from the likes of Pierre Omidyar s Humanity United the Skoll Foundation and the Conrad N Hilton Foundation to finance reporting on topics including modern day slavery and climate change The Guardian has stated that it has secured million in multi year funding commitments thus far The new project developed from funding relationships which the paper already had with the Ford Rockefeller and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Gates had given the organization million for its Global Development webpage As of March the journal claims to be the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels Political stance and editorial opinion Founded by textile traders and merchants in its early years The Guardian had a reputation as an organ of the middle class or in the words of C P Scott s son Ted a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last Associated at first with the Little Circle and hence with classical liberalism as expressed by the Whigs and later by the Liberal Party its political orientation underwent a decisive change after World War II leading to a gradual alignment with Labour and the political left in general The Scott Trust describes one of its core purposes to be to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation remaining faithful to its liberal tradition The paper s readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion a MORI poll taken between April and June showed that per cent of Guardian readers were Labour Party voters according to another MORI poll taken in per cent of Guardian readers were Labour voters and per cent Liberal Democrat voters The term Guardian reader can be used to imply a stereotype of liberal left wing or politically correct views Although the paper is often considered to be linked inextricably to the Labour Party three of The Guardian s four leader writers joined the more centrist Social Democratic Party on its foundation in The paper was enthusiastic in its support for Tony Blair in his successful bid to lead the Labour Party and to be elected Prime Minister On January two months before the invasion of Iraq an Observer Editorial said Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers But if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option War with Iraq may yet not come but conscious of the potentially terrifying responsibility resting with the British Government we find ourselves supporting the current commitment to a possible use of force The Guardian however opposed the war along with the Daily Mirror and The Independent Then Guardian features editor Ian Katz asserted in that it is no secret we are a centre left newspaper In Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley said that editorial contributors were a mix of right of centre libertarians greens Blairites Brownites Labourite but less enthusiastic Brownites etc and that the newspaper was clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive She also said that you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election The Guardian s stance will not be dictated by the editor still less any foreign proprietor it helps that there isn t one but will be the result of vigorous debate within the paper The paper s comment and opinion pages though often written by centre left contributors such as Polly Toynbee have allowed some space for right of centre voices such as Sir Max Hastings and Michael Gove Since an editorial in The Guardian has favoured abolition of

rigging by Robert Mugabe s ZANU PF party during the Zimbabwe election won best news programme of the year at the Broadcast Awards References in popular culture The paper s nickname The Grauniad sometimes abbreviated as Graun originated with the satirical magazine Private Eye This anagram played on The Guardian s early reputation for frequent typographical errors including misspelling its own name as The Gaurdian The first issue of the newspaper contained a number of errors including a notification that there would soon be some goods sold at atction instead of auction Fewer typographical errors are seen in the paper since the end of hot metal typesetting One Guardian writer Keith Devlin suggested that the high number of observed misprints was due more to the quality of the readership than the misprints greater frequency The newspaper was printed in Manchester until and the fact that the prints sent to London by train were the early more error prone prints may have contributed to
