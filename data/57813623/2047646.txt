An emote is an entry in a text based chat client that indicates an action taking place Unlike emoticons they are not text art and instead describe the action using words or images similar to emoji Emotes were created by Shigetaka Kurita in Japan whose original idea was to create a way of communication using pictures Kurita would draw pictures of himself for inspiration for the emotes he created Nowadays emotes are a language of their own emotes have progressed far past their original counterparts in Overview In most IRC chat clients entering the command me will print the user s name followed by whatever text follows For example if a user named Joe typed me jumps with joy the client will print this as Joe jumps with joy in the chat window Joe Allow me to demonstrate Joe jumps with joy again In chat media that do not support the me command it is conventional to read text surrounded by asterisks as if it were emoted For example reading Joe jumps with joy in a chat log would suggest that the user had intended the words to be performed rather than spoken In MMORPGs with visible avatars such as EverQuest Asheron s Call Second Life and World of Warcraft certain commands entered through the chat interface will print a predefined me emote to the chat window and cause the character to animate and in some cases produce sound effects For example entering confused into World of Warcraft s chat interface will play an animation on the user s avatar and print You are hopelessly confused in the chat window Emotes are used primarily online in video games and more recently on smartphones Image based emotes are frequently used in the chat feature of the streaming service Twitch Twitch also allows users to upload animated emotes encoded with the GIF format See also Emoji References Sources History of emotes and why we use them Reader s Digest History of emotes in gifs PC Gamer Complete history of the emote Wired Animate your Emote and Convert it to a GIF SuperEmotes
