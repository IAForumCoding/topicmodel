conservative position and sold predominantly amongst the retired officer class Originally William Ewart Berry st Viscount Camrose bought The Morning Post with the intention of publishing it alongside

government s official newspaper In February the chief political commentator of the Daily Telegraph Peter Oborne resigned Oborne accused the paper of a form of fraud on its readers for its coverage of the bank HSBC in relation to a Swiss tax dodging scandal that was widely covered by other news media He alleged that editorial decisions about news content had been heavily influenced by the advertising arm of the newspaper because of commercial interests Jay Rosen at New York University stated that Oborne s resignation statement was one of the most important things a journalist has written about journalism lately Oborne cited other instances of advertising strategy influencing the content of articles linking the refusal to take an editorial stance on the repression of democratic demonstrations in Hong Kong to the Telegraph s support from China Additionally he said that favourable reviews of the Cunard cruise liner Queen Mary II appeared in the Telegraph noting On May last year The Telegraph ran a long feature on Cunard s Queen Mary II liner on the news review page This episode looked to many like a plug for an advertiser on a page normally dedicated to serious news analysis I again checked and certainly Telegraph competitors did not view Cunard s liner as a major news story Cunard is an important Telegraph advertiser In response the Telegraph called Oborne s statement an astonishing and unfounded attack full of inaccuracy and innuendo Later that month Telegraph editor Chris Evans invited journalists at the newspaper to contribute their thoughts on the issue Press Gazette reported later in that Oborne had joined the Daily Mail tabloid newspaper and The Telegraph had issued new guidelines over the way editorial and commercial staff work together In

linked to Islamic extremist and Holocaust denier in which it was reported that the police were investigating Ahammed Hussain the Leader of the Scout Group at the Lewisham Islamic Centre because he had

never supported or promoted terrorism or been antisemitic The paper paid Hussain damages and costs In a letter sent to Hussain s lawyers accompanying the text of their published apology the newspaper s lawyers wrote The article was published by our client following receipt of information in good faith from the Scout Association and the Henry Jackson Society nevertheless our client now accepts that

immunity Boris will face a reckoning on this pointless and damaging lockdown which spread COVID misinformation that the common cold provided natural immunity to COVID and that London was probably approaching herd immunity The regulator said that a correction was appropriate rather than a more serious response due to the level of scientific uncertainty at the time the comment was published At the time of the ruling the Telegraph had removed the comment article but had not issued a correction Climate change The Telegraph has published multiple columns and news articles which promote pseudoscientific views on climate change and misleadingly cast the subject of climate change as a subject of active scientific debate when there is a scientific consensus on climate change It has published columns about the conspiracy behind the Anthropogenic Global Warming myth described climate scientists as white coated prima donnas and narcissists and claimed that global warming causes about as much damage as benefits In a Telegraph news article incorrectly claimed that scientists predicted a mini ice age by Climate change denying journalist James Delingpole was first to use Climategate on his Telegraph blog for a manufactured controversy where emails were leaked from climate scientists ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit and misleadingly presented to give the appearance that the climate scientists were engaged in fraud In The Telegraph was one of several media titles to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee Communicating climate science The paper told MPs they believe climate change is happening and humans play a role in it Editors told the committee we believe that the climate is changing that the reason for that change includes human activity but that human ingenuity and adaptability should not be ignored in favour of economically damaging prescriptions In November the journalist and climate activist group DeSmog published

between RedBird Capital partner and the UAE based International Media Investment to regain The Telegraph The UK lawmakers said the UAE royal family s hold on The Telegraph may be a risk to our national security The possibility that an association backed by Abu Dhabi could own an important British newspaper group worried representatives of all parties together with human rights campaigners since the UAE does not respect freedom of speech also detains activists academics and lawyers The culture secretary Lucy Frazer issued a public interest intervention notice on November preventing the group from taking over without further scrutiny from the media regulator Ofcom over potential breaches of media standards Conservative MPs also called on Oliver Dowden Deputy PM of the UK to use the National Security and Investment Act to investigate the Emirati takeover Chairman Andrew Neil threatened to quit if the sale was approved saying You cannot have a major mainstream newspaper group
