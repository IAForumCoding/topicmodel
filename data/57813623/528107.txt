Deer and three affiliates owned by Jim Pattison Group in British Columbia CKPG Prince George and CFJC Kamloops and Alberta CHAT Medicine Hat The E television system shut down on September due to low ratings and corporate financial difficulties that eventually led to Canwest filing for bankruptcy protection and selling its properties to Shaw Media for US million the E owned and operated stations experienced varied fates CHCH and CJNT were sold to Channel Zero CHEK was sold to an employee led group CHBC remained with Canwest and was converted into a Global O O and CHCA ceased operations outright while the Pattison Group stations affiliated with the Rogers Media owned Citytv system As E local news and other regional programming as well as most local community sponsorships on the O O stations used local branding incorporating the callsign branding scheme common with Canadian stations not owned by a network or television system This decision was at least partly made to avoid confusion with E News but likely intended to ensure that local newscasts were not perceived as celebrity oriented The E brand would later return to Canada on November when CTVglobemedia whose assets
