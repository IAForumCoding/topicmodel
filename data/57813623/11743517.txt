Dominic in the campaign mode or as any of the human or Locust characters in multiplayer mode can only carry a pistol one type of grenade and two other weapons at any time though they may swap these for weapons found in strategic locations or left by downed foes or fallen allies Each weapon can be used for normal fire as well as for melee attacks the game s signature Lancer Assault Rifle can be used to instantly kill foes in melee with its mounted chainsaw bayonet The game introduces the ability to engage in chainsaw duels should the player attempt to chainsaw an opponent also using the Lancer the player is presented with a controller button to press rapidly to try to win the duel and avoid death Gears of War rebalances the power of the existing weapons while introducing five new ones a flamethrower a chain gun a mortar cannon a Gorgon Pistol and the Ink Grenade The chain gun and the mortar are heavy weapons forcing the player to move at walking speed while carrying it in both hands The Gorgon Pistol is an SMG like machine pistol that fires four four shot bursts per magazine The Ink Grenade doesn t damage with its detonation but instead temporarily poisons the area it was thrown making it very useful for driving enemies out of cover Grenades can be planted on walls or floors as proximity traps that go off when an enemy nears but only fragmentation grenades have the ability to kill foes when they go off The player s health is represented by a red Crimson Omen that fades onto the screen the more damage the player takes staying out of the line of fire allows the player to recover their health Depending on the game mode or difficulty if the player takes too much damage they enter a downed state where they can crawl around the map to get out of battle and seek help During this time a teammate can revive him an enemy may brutally execute the downed player or the player may bleed out if too much time has passed The player can also grab a downed character and use them as a meatshield allowing the body to absorb damage but forcing the player to use a one handed pistol Explosive weapons will simply destroy the character they strike Like its predecessor Gears of War features an optional mature content filter which when active makes blood appear as sparks and removes harsh language from the dialogue Furthermore progress towards most of the Xbox achievements

of the underground army of the Locust Horde was destroyed the explosion also caused much of the liquid Imulsion underground to vaporize causing a fatal disease called Rustlung to spread among the diminished human population After months of peace the cities of Tollen and Montevado suddenly and mysteriously disappear underground leading the Coalition of Ordered Governments COG to suspect the resurgence of the Locust Soon after the once impenetrable Jacinto one of the last remaining safe havens for humans begins to show signs that the same fate awaits it To stop the fall of Jacinto the COG responds with a large scale counter offensive against the Locust Senior Producer Rod Fergusson says In order to save Jacinto the COG have no choice but to take the war to the Locust Characters

military leader of COG Tai Kaliso a spiritual and meditative warrior from a tradition of honor bound fighters and Dizzy Wallin a former Stranded who joined the COG to keep his family safe Dom s wife Maria also makes an appearance and Dom s search for her plays an important part in the story Plot As Gears of War begins the COG army mobilizes forces to deploy into the depths of Sera known as the Hollow to assault the Locust directly Delta Squad consisting of Marcus Fenix Dom Santiago Benjamin Carmine Tai Kaliso Augustus Cole and Damon Baird fight the Locust alongside thousands of Gears During the battle Tai is taken prisoner by Locust general Skorge and is tortured to the point of insanity resulting in him committing suicide after being freed by Delta They discover that the Locust are using a giant Riftworm to sink the human cities The Locust plan to destroy the rock structures in the outskirts of Jacinto the last major human city in hopes of sinking it underground Delta kills the Riftworm from within before it can sink Jacinto but they lose Carmine in the process After returning to the surface Colonel Hoffman admits the COG failed in locating the Locust stronghold Chairman Prescott declassifies an intel file that reveals a nearby abandoned COG outpost that has a lead on the location of the Locust capital and their queen Delta is ordered to investigate Inside Delta learns that the outpost is New Hope a genetics lab dedicated to studying human children of Imulsion miners suffering from Rustlung resulting in mutated experiments called Sires Delta finds that the scientists relocated to the nearby caverns of Mount Kadar to continue their research As Delta infiltrates Mount Kadar to infiltrate the Locust stronghold Dom gets a lead on his missing wife Maria located at a nearby prison camp Dom finds Maria in a vegetative state due to the aggressive and invasive torture techniques of the Locust Dom euthanizes Maria and continues on the mission Delta

have been forcing the Locust out of the Hollow and onto the surface Locust Queen Myrrah who appears human reveals to Marcus that the Locust are trying to sink Jacinto based on a proposal by Adam Fenix his father that the surrounding seawater could flood the Hollow and drown the Lambent After a battle where they succeed in killing Skorge but failing to kill Myrrah Marcus decides to destroy both the Locust and Lambent forces by sinking Jacinto themselves before the Locust can evacuate Jacinto is sunk by the COG and seawater floods into the crater destroying the remaining Locust forces After the

to the engine with specific reference to the sequel itself The video showed several demonstrations of the improvements the initial being improvements to the in game lighting through Screen Space Ambient Occlusion in which dynamic shadows could be generated through the use of a pixel shading technique to render more realistically lit and shaded objects and actors illustrated through comparison between character and environment models in the original game engine to that of Unreal Engine Also showcased was the ability of the engine to render hordes of actors within the engine as demonstrated with a large crowd of locust flocking through the Gridlock multiplayer map from the original game Alongside this technology was improvements to Matinee an artistic tool used for the rendering and editing dimensional scenes within the game Other physics related features included improvements to the rendering of water in which specular light and physical interactions with were displayed more realistically improvements to soft body entities demonstrated with a Meat Cube and a floating ball possessing properties similar to that of liquid helium The largest of these physics engine related changes was the introduction of destructible environments due to the implementation of real time structural analysis tools to generate the damage of the materials and subsequently their deformed shapes based upon resultant forces placed upon them This was demonstrated with the use of explosive arrows fired from the Torque Bow of the original game causing damage to wooden planks and also revealing rebar present after destroying areas of a stone structure Downloadable content and updates On February coinciding with the game s announcement at the Game Developers Conference a free set of

Centaur Tank replica just like the new vehicle introduced in the game free of charge Reception Critical reception Gears of War received widespread critical acclaim It currently holds a aggregate review score at GameRankings and a from the aggregate review website Metacritic While the game has been praised for the addition of a deeper plot than the original Gears of War and being highly polished reviewers noted that the multiplayer experience did not resemble the previous game especially in its quick pace and enjoyability IGN noted that while the first four acts of the game were satisfying in the final act the last boss is a complete joke and the ending feels just a tad too abrupt and that there were some bugs and lag in the online multiplayer Overall IGN stated that Gears of War has its flaws when it comes to the technical side of multiplayer and the last act of the campaign and the voice acting might turn some off Still none of that comes close to holding back Gears of War from its destiny being one of the best games available on the Xbox Also even though the new plot was praised critics such as Official Xbox Magazine scrutinized the game s middle acts saying that most of the plot falls flat Both IGN and Eurogamer among others positively mentioned the new Horde Mode feature with Eurogamer saying that Horde is a weighty slab of fun that can turn almost any of them into a time sink and the leaderboards are likely to be as compelling a reason to stick with Gears of War as the leveling system has been for Call of Duty Modern Warfare X Play praised the game for its polished cover system and cooperative campaign mode X Play also praised the new weapons and characters and its brilliant multiplayer experience Game Informer called the single player campaign satisfying and called the co op campaign amazing and goes on to call online multiplayer an outstanding contrast to team deathmatch or capture the flag scenarios Sales Gears of War has achieved significant success after its release In its opening weekend the game sold over two million units and set a new record for the number of simultaneous players on Xbox Live with over million people
