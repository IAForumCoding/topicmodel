Paragon was a free to play multiplayer online battle arena MOBA game developed and published by Epic Games powered by their own Unreal Engine The game started buy to play early access in March and then launched free to play access to its open beta started in August After failed attempts to make the game sustainable and having trouble keeping a player base Epic Games made the decision to shut down Paragon servers in April Gameplay Paragon was a third person multiplayer online battle arena MOBA video game The maps featured in the game were symmetrical and bases were located at the two opposite ends of a map Players were tasked with defeating the enemy team by destroying the core in their base They had the ability to reach their opponents bases through the three lanes featured in each map Each lane was protected by defensive towers that protected the bases by attacking any incoming enemies that stood within its range automatically Lanes consisted of two towers and an inhibitor destroying all of these allowed a team to spawn more powerful minions in that lane and directly attack the enemy core Between lanes were jungles inside which players could find additional resources for their teams Jungles were separated from lanes by fog walls that players could not see other players through In a match ten players were divided into two teams Each player assumed control of a Hero Each hero had their own basic attack and possessed a set of four abilities composed of active attacks or maneuvers or passive buffs that helped them or their teammates Different heroes had different skills and weapons For instance TwinBlast an offensive hero primarily fires two pistols and throws grenades while Muriel a defensive hero aids her allies with a shield Heroes came in ranged and melee classes Each hero had an ultimate ability for example ranged hero Murdock can fire a massive laser with infinite range Both teams had minions which jog toward their opponents bases and support the heroes Super Minions entered the lanes upon destroying the enemy inhibitors When players killed an enemy hero or minion or destroy an enemy tower they gained experience and gold Experience allowed players to level up and unlock or upgrade abilities Just before a match started players could choose a deck of cards that allows players to use gold to purchase upgrades such as health boosts and strength enhancing artifacts for their heroes Players could use a default deck or build their own when not playing a match Cards and decks were divided into five different affinities Each deck had two affinities and had to contain cards with either of those affinities Chests loot boxes which contained cards could be earned through rewards from completing matches Players could also use real world currency to boost their reputation points and experience points According to Epic the game was not pay to win As a result players may only purchase cosmetic items with real world currency or coins found within loot chests The game also featured a replay system which allowed players to spectate matches The game regularly added new heroes and edited the main battle map through updates Development Paragon was in development at Epic Games According to executive producer John Wasilczyk the team was given the chance to make anything and had a lot of creative freedom when they started the project One of the main goals for developing the game was to introduce action elements into the genre To achieve this the game features gameplay similar to a third person shooter and the in game characters were designed to possess mobility skills For example characters like Khaimera have the ability to leap and strike while Kallari possesses the ability to do a double backflip The team also focused on verticality while developing the game s maps which allowed them to turn the moments shown in MOBA CGI s trailers into an actual gameplay experience According to Steve Superville the game s creative director the maps were designed to shape like a bowl so that players can look across the map easily when they respawn observe the battle situation and plan their attacks strategically The card system was designed to make the game more accessible for new players simplify the traditional item system and create more strategic choices According to Epic it is a feature that can help the game to differentiate itself from its competitors Epic also transferred some of the resources for making Fortnite to Paragon s development Wasilczyk also stated that potentials for an esport series were being considered depending on the demand of the community and the game s popularity Paragon was set to be a non boxed game released by Epic According to Superville the team were excited about the change as this format allows them to receive responses from the community and make adjustments immediately The game was announced on November and the first gameplay trailer debuted at PlayStation Experience The game entered early access on March for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows with cross platform play having been tested a month earlier While the product was free to play payment was required for early access to the game before the open beta release on August The early access version of the game had three versions Founder s Pack Challenger Packs and Master Packs all of which featured cosmetic items
