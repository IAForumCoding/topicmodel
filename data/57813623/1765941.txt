collects revenue from affiliate marketing by advertising deals and discounts from online retailers and from the sale of Ars Technica branded merchandise Advertisement block On March Ars Technica experimentally blocked readers who used Adblock Plus one of several computer programs that stop advertisements from being displayed in a web browser from viewing the website Fisher estimated of the website s readers had the software installed at the time The next day the block was lifted and the article Why Ad Blocking is devastating to the sites you love was published on Ars Technica imploring readers not to use the software on websites they care about blocking ads can be devastating to the sites you love I am not making an argument that blocking ads is a form of stealing or is immoral or unethical It can result in people losing their jobs it can result in less content on any given site and it definitely can affect the quality of content It can also put sites into a real advertising death spin The block and article were controversial generating articles on other websites about them and the broader issue of advertising ethics Readers of Ars Technica generally followed Fisher s persuasion the day after his article was published readers who used the software had allowed the display of advertisements on Ars Technica in their browser and readers had subscribed to Ars Premier In February Fisher noted That article lowered the ad block rate by percent and what we found was that the majority of people blocking ads on our site were doing it because other sites were irritating them In response to increasing use of ad blockers Ars Technica intends to identify readers who filter out advertisements and ask them to support the site by several means See also Technology
