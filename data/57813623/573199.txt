was studying mechanical engineering and living in a dorm at the University of Maryland He frequently visited his parents who lived in nearby Potomac Maryland where his personal computer used for both work and leisure was situated Out of this location Sweeney started Potomac Computer Systems as a computer consulting business but later figured that it would be too much work he would have to put into keeping the business stable and scrapped the idea After finishing his game ZZT Sweeney opted to re use the Potomac Computer Systems name to release the game to the public in January It was only with the unexpected success of ZZT caused in most part by the easy modifiability of the game using Sweeney s custom ZZT oop programming language that made Sweeney consider turning Potomac Computer Systems into a video game company ZZT was sold through bulletin board systems while all orders were fulfilled by Sweeney s father Paul Sweeney The game sold several thousand copies as of May and Paul Sweeney still lived at the former Potomac Computer Systems address at the time fulfilling all orders that eventually came by mail The final copy of ZZT was shipped by Paul Sweeney in November Epic MegaGames In early Sweeney found himself and his new found video game company in a business where larger studios such as Apogee Software and id Software were dominant and he had to find a more serious name for his As such Sweeney came up with Epic MegaGames a name which incorporated Epic and Mega to make it sound like it represented a fairly large company such as Apogee Software although he was its only employee Sweeney soon underwent searching for a business partner and eventually caught up with Mark Rein who previously quit his job at id Software and moved to Toronto Ontario Rein worked remotely from Toronto and primarily handled sales marketing and publishing deals business development that Sweeney found to have significantly contributed to the company s growth Some time this season the company soon had employees consisting of programmers artists designers and composers Among them was the year old Cliff Bleszinski who joined the company after submitting his game Dare to Dream to Sweeney The following year they had over employees In Epic MegaGames produced a shareware isometric shooter called Fire Fight developed by Polish studio Chaos Works It was published by Electronic Arts

company also began to license the core technology the Unreal Engine to other game developers Epic Games present Unreal and personal computer games In February Epic MegaGames announced that they had moved their headquarters to a new location in Cary North Carolina and would henceforth be known as simply Epic Games Rein explained that Unreal was first created by developers who were scattered across the world eventually the team came together to finish the game and that s when the real magic started The move to North Carolina centralizes Epic bringing all of the company s talented developers under one roof Furthermore Sweeney stated that the Mega part of the name was dropped because they no longer wanted to pretend to be a big company as was the original intention of the name when it was a one man team The follow up game Unreal Tournament shipped to critical acclaim the same year at which point the studio had employees The company launched the Make Something Unreal competition in aiming to reward video game developers who create mods using the Unreal game engine Tripwire Interactive won US in cash and computer hardware prizes over the course of the contest in the first contest in Gears of War and console games Around the personal computer video game market was struggling with copyright infringement in the form of software piracy and it became difficult to make single player games elements that had been part of Epic s business model to that point The company decided to shift focus into developing console systems a move which Sweeney called the start of the third major iteration of the company Epic In Epic released the Xbox shooter Gears of War which became a commercial success for the company grossing about million off a million budget A year later the company released Unreal Tournament for PC and acquired a majority share in People Can Fly In Epic Games released Gears of War selling over three million copies within the first month of its

Gears of War Judgement which was released in At this point Epic had considered developing a fourth main title for Gears of War but estimated that its budget would be at least million Additionally they had suggested the idea of a multiplayer only version of Gears of War that featured improved versions of maps based on user feedback similar to the concept behind Unreal Tournament but Microsoft rejected this idea Epic recognized the troubles of being held to the business objectives of a publisher and began to shift the company again Games as a service and Tencent shareholding Coupled with their desire to move away from being beholden to a publisher Epic Games observed that the video game industry was shifting to a games as a service model GaaS Sweeney stated There was an increasing realization that the old model wasn t working anymore and that the new model was looking increasingly like the way to go In an attempt to gain more GaaS experience they made an agreement with Chinese Tencent who had several games under their banner including Riot Games League of Legends operating successfully as games as a service In exchange for Tencent s help Tencent acquired approximately of Epic then issued share capital equating to of total Epic inclusive of both stock and employee stock options for million in June Tencent Holdings has the right to nominate directors to the board of Epic Games and thus counts as an associate of the Group However Sweeney stated that Tencent otherwise has very little control on the creative output of Epic Games Sweeney considered the partial acquisition by Tencent as the start of Epic the fourth major iteration of the company allowing the company to be more agile in the video game marketplace Around this point Epic had about employees A number of high profile staff left the company months after the Tencent deal was announced for various reasons Some notable departures included Cliff Bleszinski then the design director announced he was leaving Epic Games in October after years with the company His official reason was It s time for a much needed break Bleszinski later stated that he had become jaded about the gaming industry in the lead up to Tencent s involvement After Tencent s investment Bleszinski attempted to renegotiate his contract but failed to come to terms making him think about retirement instead He opted to stop coming to work spending his time at his beach house eventually leading Sweeney to come down and have a heart to heart discussion with Bleszinski on the new direction Epic was going and asking him to make a firm decision regarding his commitment to Epic Bleszinski opted to write his resignation letter the next day After about two years Bleszinski started Boss Key Productions in President Mike Capps announced his retirement in December and cited as reasons the birth of a baby boy he was having with his wife and his plans to be a stay at home dad He subsequently announced quitting his advisory role as well as his affiliation with the company in March Rod Fergusson who had been a lead developer for the Gears of War series left Epic in August Fergusson stated that he had seen the direction that the Tencent acquisition would have taken the company and was not interested in the free to play style of games but instead wanted to continue developing a AAA big narrative big story big impact game Fergusson briefly joined Irrational Games owned by K Games to help complete BioShock Infinite While there Fergusson talked with K about potentially continuing the Gears of War series leading to talks between K Games Epic and Microsoft As a result Microsoft acquired the rights to Gears of War on January eventually assigned those to Microsoft Game Studios Fergusson moved to Black Tusk Studios owned by Microsoft Game Studios to take on lead development for a new Gears title with the studio being rebranded as The Coalition The first game since the acquisition Gears of War was released in October Adrian Chmielarz the founder of People Can Fly who joined Epic when his studio was acquired earlier in decided to leave after Tencent s acquisition stating that he and other former People Can Fly members did not believe the free to play games as a service direction fit their own personal vision or direction they wanted to go Chmielarz and these others left Epic in late to form The Astronauts Lee Perry a lead designer on both Unreal and Gears of War series felt that Epic has started to grow too large to maintain a role as an eccentric game developer Coupled with the studio s need for more management to support the games as a service model Perry felt that their creative freedom would become limited He and five other senior people left Epic to form a new studio Bitmonster Epic continued its goal to deliver games as a service following these departures Fortnite was to serve as their testbed for living games but with the shifts in staff and its engine from Unreal Engine to its release suffered some setbacks Epic started additional projects the free to play and community developed Unreal Tournament first announced in and the free to play multiplayer online battle

Former Legal issues Litigation with Silicon Knights On July Canadian game studio Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for failure to provide a working game engine causing the Ontario based game developer to experience considerable losses The suit alleged that Epic Games was sabotaging Unreal Engine licensees Epic s licensing document stated that a working version of the engine would be available within six months of the Xbox developer kits being released Silicon Knights claimed that Epic missed this deadline and that when a working version of the engine was eventually released the documentation was insufficient The game studio also claimed Epic had withheld vital improvements to the game engine claiming they were game specific while also using licensing fees to fund the development of its own titles rather than the engine itself In August Epic Games counter sued Silicon Knights alleging the studio was aware when it signed on that certain features of Unreal Engine were still in development and that components would continue to be developed and added as Epic completed work on Gears of War Therefore in a statement Epic said that SK knew when it committed to the licensing agreement that Unreal Engine may not meet its requirements and may not be modified to meet them Additionally the counter suit claimed that Silicon Knights had made unauthorized use of Epic s Licensed Technology and had infringed and otherwise violated Epic s intellectual property rights including Epic s copyrighted works trade secrets know how and confidential information by incorporating Unreal Engine code into its own engine the Silicon Knights Engine Furthermore Epic asserted the Canadian developer broke the contract when it employed this derivative work in an internal title and a second game with Sega a partnership for which it never received a license fee On May Epic Games defeated Silicon Knights lawsuit and won its counter suit for million on grounds of copyright infringement misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract an injury award that was later doubled due to prejudgment interest attorneys fees and costs Consistent with Epic s counterclaims the presiding judge James C Dever III stated that Silicon Knights had deliberately and repeatedly copied thousands of lines of Epic Games copyrighted code and then attempted to conceal its wrongdoing by removing Epic Games copyright notices and by disguising Epic Games copyrighted code as Silicon Knights own Dever stated that evidence against Silicon Knights was overwhelming as it not only copied functional code but also non functional internal comments Epic Games programmers had left for themselves As a result on November Silicon Knights was directed by the court to destroy all game code derived from Unreal Engine all information from licensee restricted areas of Epic s Unreal Engine documentation website and to permit Epic Games access to the company s servers and other devices to ensure these items have been removed In addition the studio was instructed to recall and destroy all unsold retail copies of games built with Unreal Engine code including Too Human X Men Destiny The Sandman The Box Ritualyst and Siren in the Maelstrom the latter three titles were projects never released or even officially announced On May Silicon Knights filed for bankruptcy and a Certificate of Appointment was issued by the office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy with Collins Barrow Toronto Limited being appointed as trustee in bankruptcy Apple and Google disputes Since as early as Tim Sweeney had questioned the need for digital storefronts like Valve s Steam Apple s iOS App Store and Google Play to take a revenue sharing cut and argued that when accounting for current rates of content distribution and other factors needed a revenue cut of should be sufficient to run any digital storefront profitably When Epic brought Fortnite Battle Royale to mobile devices the company initially offered a sideloaded package for Android systems to bypass the Google Play store but eventually also made it a store app On August Epic Games updated Fortnite across all platforms including the iOS and Android versions to reduce the price of V Bucks the in game currency by if they purchased directly from Epic For iOS and Android users if they purchased through the Apple or Google storefront they were not given this discount as Epic said they could not extend the discount due to the revenue cut taken by Apple and Google Within hours both Apple and Google had removed Fortnite from their storefronts stating the means of bypassing their payment systems violated the terms of service Epic immediately filed separate lawsuits against Apple and Google for antitrust and anticompetitive behavior in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California Epic did not seek monetary damages in either case but instead was seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands if not more of third party app developers In comments on social media the next day Sweeney said that they undertook the actions as we re fighting for the freedom of people who bought smartphones to install apps from sources of their choosing the freedom for creators of apps to distribute them as they choose and the freedom of both groups to do business directly The primary opposing argument is Smartphone markers sic can do whatever they want This is an awful notion We all have rights and we need to fight to defend our rights against whoever would deny them Apple responded to the lawsuit that it would terminate Epic s developer accounts by August leading Epic to file a motion for a preliminary injunction to force Apple to return Fortnite to the App Store and prevent them from terminating Epic s developer accounts as the latter action would leave Epic unable to update the Unreal Engine for any changes to iOS or macOS and leave developers that relied on Unreal at risk The court granted the preliminary injunction against Apple from terminating the developer accounts as Epic had shown potential significant damage to both the Unreal Engine platform itself and to the gaming industry generally but refused to grant the injunction related to Fortnite as The current predicament appears of Epic s own making In September Epic Games together with thirteen other companies launched the Coalition for App Fairness which aimed for better conditions for the inclusion of apps into app stores U S District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued her first ruling on Epic Games v Apple on September Rogers found in favor of Apple on nine of ten counts brought up against them in the case including Epic s charges related to Apple s revenue cut and Apple s prohibition against third party marketplaces on the iOS environment Rogers did rule against Apple on the final charge related to anti steering provisions and issued a permanent injunction that in days from the ruling blocked Apple from preventing developers from linking app users to other storefronts from within apps to complete purchases or from collecting information within an app such as an email to notify users of these storefronts Rogers ruling was upheld at the Ninth Circuit on appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case leaving Rogers order against Apple in place Google initially sought to negotiate with Epic but later filed their own countersuit against Epic for breach of contract The Google case was set as a jury trial held in November and December Prior to this other groups had filed their own lawsuits against Google for similar reasons as Epic including a coalition of states and the Match Group but these were settled just ahead of the trial The jury found for Epic on all claims made determining that Google maintained a monopoly on the Android marketplace by how it managed the Play Store and used its leverage as a big tech firm to make deal with partners including some deals made as a result of the earlier settlements A second phase of this trial to determine remedies is scheduled to occur in January FTC child privacy settlement In December Epic Games was fined a combined million after the Federal Trade Commission accused the company of separate accounts related to Fortnite one for violating COPPA related to children s privacy by collecting personal data without parent or guardian consent exposing children and teens to potential harassment and a second related to misleading users into making unwanted purchases while playing the game Epic Games said No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here The laws have not changed but their application has evolved and long standing industry practices are no longer enough We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players Over the past few years we ve been making changes to ensure our ecosystem meets the expectations of our players and regulators which we hope will be a helpful guide for others in our industry Criticism Since the partial investment by the Chinese company Tencent some consumers have become wary of Epic Games reliability and use of their data particularly in relationship with the Epic Games Store These concerns have been connected to broader issues of general distrust of the Chinese government and Chinese corporations among some Western video game players Epic has stated that Tencent does not have access to any of this private data nor provides this to the Chinese government In late March accusations began circulating on social media that the Epic Games social networking app Houseparty led to other services such as Netflix and Spotify being hacked However both Epic and Life on Air claimed this was a smear campaign against its product and offered a million bounty for anyone able to substantiate their claim Notes References Further reading Keighley Geoffrey Blinded By Reality The True Story
