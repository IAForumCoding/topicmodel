A platformer also called a platform game and sometimes a jump n run game is a sub genre of action video games in which the core objective is to move the player character between points in an environment Platform games are characterized by levels with uneven terrain and suspended platforms of varying height that require jumping and climbing to traverse Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay such as swinging from vines or grappling hooks jumping off walls gliding through the air or bouncing from springboards or trampolines The genre started with the arcade video game Space Panic which has ladders but not jumping Donkey Kong released in established a template for what were initially called climbing games Donkey Kong inspired many clones and games with similar elements such as Miner er and Kangaroo while the Sega arcade game Congo Bongo adds a third dimension via isometric graphics Another popular game of that period Pitfall allows moving left and right through series of non scrolling screens expanding the play area Nintendo s flagship Super Mario Bros was a defining game for the nascent genre with horizontally scrolling levels and the player controlling a named character Mario which became a mascot of the company The term platform game gained traction in the late s as did the alternate form platformer During their peak of popularity platformers were estimated to comprise between a quarter and a third of all console games By the genre had experienced a decline in sales representing a market share as compared to in In spite of this platformers are still being commercially released every year including some which have sold millions of copies Concepts A platformer requires the player to maneuver their character across platforms to reach a goal while confronting enemies and avoiding obstacles along the way These games are either presented from the side view using two dimensional movement or in D with the camera placed either behind the main character or in isometric perspective Typical platforming gameplay tends to be very dynamic and challenges a player s reflexes timing and dexterity with controls The most common movement options in the genre are walking running jumping attacking and climbing Jumping is central to the genre though there are exceptions such as Nintendo s Popeye and Data East s BurgerTime both from In some games such as Donkey Kong the trajectory of a jump is fixed while in others it can be altered mid air Falling may cause damage or death Many platformers contain environmental obstacles which kill the player s character upon contact such as lava pits or bottomless chasms The player may be able to collect items and power ups and give the main character new abilities for overcoming adversities Most games of this genre consist of multiple levels of increasing difficulty that may be interleaved by boss encounters where the character has to defeat a particularly dangerous enemy to progress Simple logical puzzles to resolve and skill trials to overcome other common elements in the genre A modern variant of the platform game especially significant on mobile platforms is the endless runner where the main character is always moving forward and the player must dodge or jump to avoid falling or hitting obstacles Naming Various names were used in the years following the release of the first established game in the genre Donkey Kong Shigeru Miyamoto originally called it a running jumping climbing game while developing it Miyamoto commonly used the term athletic game to refer to Donkey Kong and later games in the genre such as Super Mario Bros Donkey Kong spawned other games with a mix of running jumping and vertical traversal a novel genre that did not match the style of games that came before it leaving journalists and writers to offer their own terms Computer and Video Games magazine among others referred to the genre as Donkey Kong type or Kong style games Climbing games was used in Steve Bloom s book Video Invaders and magazines Electronic Games US which ran a cover feature called The Player s Guide to Climbing Games and TV Gamer UK Bloom defined climbing games as titles where the player must climb from the bottom of the screen to the top while avoiding and or destroying the obstacles and foes you invariably meet along the way Under this definition he listed Space Panic Donkey Kong and despite the top down perspective Frogger as climbing games In a December Creative Computing review of the Apple II game Beer Run the reviewer used a different term I m going to call this a ladder game as in the ladder genre which includes Apple Panic and Donkey Kong That label was also used by Video Games Player magazine in when it named the Coleco port of Donkey Kong Ladder Game of the Year Another term used in the late s to s was character action games in reference to games such as Super Mario Bros Sonic the Hedgehog and Bubsy It was also applied more generally to side scrolling video games including run and gun video games such as Gunstar Heroes Platform game became a common term for the genre by popularized by its usage in the United Kingdom press Examples include referring to the Super Mario mould such as Kato chan Ken chan as platform games and calling Strider a platform and ladders game History Single screen The genre originated in the early s Levels in early platform games were confined to a single screen generally viewed in profile and based on climbing between platforms rather than jumping Space Panic a arcade release by Universal is sometimes credited as the first platformer Another precursor to the genre from was Nichibutsu s Crazy Climber in which the player character scales vertically scrolling skyscrapers The unreleased Intellivision game Hard Hat has a similar concept Donkey Kong an arcade video game created by Nintendo and released in July was the first game to allow players to jump over obstacles and gaps It is widely considered to be the first platformer It introduced Mario under the name Jumpman Donkey Kong was ported to many consoles and computers at the time notably as the system selling pack in game for ColecoVision and also a handheld version from Coleco in The game helped cement Nintendo s position as an important name in the video game industry internationally The following year Donkey Kong received a sequel Donkey Kong Jr and later Mario Bros a platformer with two player cooperative play It laid the groundwork for other two player cooperative platformers such as Fairyland Story and Bubble Bobble Beginning in transitional games emerged with non scrolling levels spanning multiple screens David Crane s Pitfall for the Atari with horizontally connected screens became one of the best selling games on the system and was a breakthrough for the genre Smurf Rescue in Gargamel s Castle was released on the ColecoVision that same year adding uneven terrain and scrolling pans between static screens Manic Miner and its sequel Jet Set Willy continued this style of multi screen levels on home computers Wanted Monty Mole won the first award for Best Platform game in from Crash magazine Later that same year Epyx released Impossible Mission and Parker Brothers released Montezuma s Revenge which further expanded on the exploration aspect Scrolling The first platformer to use scrolling graphics came years before the genre became popular Jump Bug is a platform shooter developed by Alpha Denshi under contract for Hoei Coreland and released to arcades in only five months after Donkey Kong Players control a bouncing car that jumps on various platforms such as buildings clouds and hills Jump Bug offered a glimpse of what was to come with uneven suspended platforms levels that scroll horizontally and in one section vertically and differently themed sections such as a city the interior of a large pyramid and underwater Irem s arcade game Moon Patrol combines jumping over obstacles and shooting attackers A month later Taito released Jungle King a side scrolling action game some platform elements jumping between vines jumping or running beneath bouncing boulders It was quickly re released as Jungle Hunt because of similarities to Tarzan The Apple II game Track Attack includes a scrolling platform level where the character runs and leaps along the top of a moving train The character is little more than a stick figure but the acrobatics evoke the movement that games such as Prince of Persia would feature B C s Quest For Tires put a recognizable character from American comic strips into side scrolling jumping gameplay similar to Moon Patrol The same year Snokie for the Commodore and Atari bit computers added uneven terrain to a scrolling platformer Based on the Saturday morning cartoon rather than the maze game Namco s Pac Land is a bidirectional horizontally scrolling arcade video game with walking running jumping springboards power ups and a series of unique levels Pac Man creator Toru Iwatani described the game as the pioneer of action games with horizontally running background According to Iwatani Shigeru Miyamoto described Pac Land as an influence on the development of Super Mario Bros Nintendo s Super Mario Bros released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in became the archetype for the genre It was bundled with Nintendo systems in North America Japan and Europe and sold over million copies according to the Guinness Book of World Records Its success as a pack in led many companies to see platformers as vital to their success and contributed greatly to popularizing the genre during the third and fourth generations of video game consoles Sega attempted to emulate this success with their Alex Kidd series which started in on the Master System with Alex Kidd in Miracle World It has horizontal and vertical scrolling levels the ability to punch enemies and obstacles and shops for the player to buy power ups and vehicles Another Sega series that began that same year is Wonder Boy The original Wonder Boy in was inspired more by Pac Land than Super Mario Bros with skateboarding segments that gave the game a greater sense of speed than other platformers at the time while its sequel Wonder Boy in Monster Land added action adventure and role playing elements Wonder Boy in turn inspired games such as Adventure Island Dynastic Hero Popful Mail and Shantae One of the first platformers to scroll in all four directions freely and follow the on screen character s movement is in a vector game called Major Havoc which comprises a number of mini games including a simple platformer One of the first raster based platformers to scroll fluidly in all directions in this manner is s Legend of Kage In Enix released the action adventure platformer Brain Breaker The following year saw the release of Nintendo s Metroid which was critically acclaimed for a balance between open ended and guided exploration Another platform adventure released that year Pony Canyon s Super Pitfall was critically panned for its vagueness and weak game design That same year Jaleco released Esper Boukentai a sequel to Psychic that scrolled in all directions and allowed the player character to make huge multistory jumps to navigate the vertically oriented levels Telenet Japan also released its own take on the platform action game Valis which contained anime style cut scenes In Capcom s Mega Man introduced non linear level progression where the player is able to choose the order in which they complete levels This was a stark contrast to both linear games like Super Mario Bros and open world games like Metroid GamesRadar credits the level select feature of Mega Man as the basis for the non linear mission structure found in most open world multi mission sidequest heavy games Another Capcom platformer that year was Bionic Commando which popularized a grappling hook mechanic that has since appeared in dozens of games including Earthworm Jim and Tomb Raider Scrolling platformers went portable in the late s with games such as Super Mario Land and the genre continued to maintain its popularity with many games released for the handheld Game Boy and Game Gear systems Second generation side scrollers By the time the Genesis and TurboGrafx launched platformers were the most popular genre in console gaming There was a particular emphasis on having a flagship platform title exclusive to a system featuring a mascot character In Sega released Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle which was only modestly successful That same year Capcom released Strider in arcades which scrolled in multiple directions and allowed the player to summon artificial intelligence partners such as a droid tiger and hawk to help fight enemies Another Sega release in was Shadow Dancer which is a game that also included an AI partner a dog who followed the player around and aid in battle In Hudson Soft released Bonk s Adventure with a protagonist positioned as NEC s mascot The following year Takeru s Cocoron a late platformer for the Famicom allowed players to build a character from a toy box filled with spare parts In the Super Famicom was released in Japan along with the eagerly anticipated Super Mario World The following year Nintendo released the console as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America along with Super Mario World while Sega released Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis Sonic showcased a new style of design made possible by a new generation of hardware large stages that scrolled in all directions curved hills loops and a physics system allowing players to rush through its levels with well placed jumps and rolls Sega characterized Sonic as a teenager with a rebellious personality to appeal to gamers who saw the previous generation of consoles as being for kids The character s speed showed off the hardware capabilities of the Genesis which had a CPU clock speed approximately double that of the Super NES Sonic s perceived rebellious attitude became a model for game mascots Other companies attempted to duplicate Sega s success with their own brightly colored anthropomorphisms with attitude These often were characterized by impatience sarcasm and frequent quips A second generation of platformers for computers appeared alongside the new wave of consoles In the latter half of the s and early s the Amiga was a strong gaming platform with its custom video hardware and sound hardware The Atari ST was solidly supported as well Games like Shadow of the Beast and Turrican showed that computer platformers could rival their console contemporaries Prince of Persia originally a late release for the bit Apple II in featured a high quality of animation The shareware game The Adventures of Captain Comic was one of the first attempts at a Nintendo style platformer for IBM PC compatibles It inspired Commander Keen released by id Software in which became the first MS DOS platformer with smooth scrolling graphics Keen s success resulted in numerous console styled platformers for MS DOS compatible operating systems including Duke Nukem Duke Nukem II Cosmo s Cosmic Adventure and Dark Ages all by Apogee Software These fueled a brief burst of episodic platformers where the first was freely distributed and parts and were available for purchase Decline of D The abundance of platformers for bit consoles continued late into the generation with successful games such as Vectorman Donkey Kong Country Diddy s Kong Quest and Super Mario World Yoshi s Island but the release of new hardware caused players attention to move away from D genres The Sega Saturn PlayStation and Nintendo nevertheless featured a number of successful D platformers The D Rayman was a big success on bit consoles Mega Man and Mega Man X helped revitalize interest in Capcom s Mega Man character Castlevania Symphony of the Night revitalized its series and established a new foundation for later Castlevania games Oddworld and Heart of Darkness kept the subgenre born from Prince of Persia alive The difficulties of adapting platformer gameplay to three dimensions led some developers to compromise by pairing the visual flash of D with traditional D side scrolling gameplay These games are often referred to as D The first such game was the Sega Saturn launch title Clockwork Knight The game featured levels and boss characters rendered in D but retained D gameplay and used pre rendered D sprites for regular characters similar to Donkey Kong Country Its sequel improved upon its design featuring some D effects such as hopping between the foreground and background and the camera panning and curving around corners Meanwhile Pandemonium and Klonoa brought the D style to the PlayStation In a break from the past the Nintendo had the fewest side scrolling platformers with only four Yoshi s Story Kirby The Crystal Shards Goemon s Great Adventure and Mischief Makers and most met with a tepid response from critics at the time Despite this Yoshi s Story sold over a million copies in the US and Mischief Makers rode high on the charts in the months following its release Third dimension The term D platformer usually refers to games with gameplay in three dimensions and polygonal D graphics Games that have D gameplay but D graphics are usually included under the umbrella of isometric platformers while those that have D graphics but gameplay on a D plane are called D as they are a blend of D and D The first platformers to simulate a D perspective and moving camera emerged in the early mid s An early example of this was Konami s platformer Antarctic Adventure where the player controls a penguin in a forward scrolling third person perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles Originally released in for the MSX computer it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year including an arcade version NES and ColecoVision saw the release of the sequel to forward scrolling platformer Antarctic Adventure called Penguin Adventure which was designed by Hideo Kojima It included more action game elements a greater variety of levels RPG elements such as upgrading equipment and multiple endings In early Square released D WorldRunner designed by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nasir Gebelli Using a forward scrolling effect similar to Sega s third person rail shooter Space Harrier D WorldRunner was an early forward scrolling pseudo D third person platform action game where players were free to move in any forward scrolling direction and could leap over obstacles and chasms It was notable for being one of the first stereoscopic D games Square released its sequel JJ later that year The earliest example of a true D platformer is a French computer game called Alpha Waves created by Christophe de Dinechin and published by Infogrames in for the Atari ST Amiga and IBM PC compatibles Bug a Sega Saturn game that was released in offered a more conservative approach to true D platforming It allowed players to move in all directions but it did not allow movement along more than one axis at once the player could move orthogonally but not diagonally Its characters were pre rendered sprites much like the earlier Clockwork Knight The game played very similarly to D platformers but it was considered a true D title and let players walk up walls and on ceilings It has a sequel called Bug Too In Delphine Software released a D sequel to their D platformer Flashback Entitled Fade to Black it was the first attempt to bring a popular D platformer series into D While it retained the puzzle oriented level design style and step based control it did not meet the criteria of a platformer and was billed as an action adventure It used true D characters and set pieces but its environments were rendered using a rigid engine similar to the one used by Wolfenstein D in that it could only render square flat corridors rather than suspended platforms that could be jumped between Sega had tasked their American studio Sega Technical Institute with bringing Sonic the Hedgehog into D Their project titled Sonic Xtreme was to have featured a radically different approach for the series with an exaggerated fisheye camera and multidirectional gameplay reminiscent of Bug Due in part to conflicts with Sega Enterprises in Japan and a rushed schedule the game never made it to market True D In the s platforming games started to shift from pseudo D to true D which gave the player more control over the character and the camera To render a D environment from any angle the user chose the graphics hardware had to be sufficiently powerful and the art and rendering model of the game had to be viewable from every angle The improvement in graphics technology allowed publishers to make such games but introduced several new issues For example if the player could control the virtual camera it had to be constrained to stop it from clipping through the environment In a small developer called Exact released a game for the X computer called Geograph Seal which was a D first person shooter game with platforming Players piloted a frog like mech that could jump and then double jump or triple jump high into the air as the camera panned down to help players line up their landings In addition to shooting jumping on enemies was a primary way to attack This was the first true D platform action game with free roaming environments but it was never ported to another platform or released outside Japan so it remains relatively unknown in the West The following year Exact released their follow up to Geograph Seal An early title for Sony s new PlayStation console Jumping Flash released in April kept the gameplay from its precursor but traded the frog like mech for a cartoony rabbit mech called Robbit The title was successful enough to get two sequels and is remembered for being the first D platformer on a console Rob Fahey of Eurogamer said Jumping Flash was perhaps one of the most important ancestors of every D platformer in the following decade It holds the record of First platform videogame in true D according to Guinness World Records Another early D platformer was Floating Runner developed by a Japanese company called Xing and released for PlayStation in early before the release of Super Mario Floating Runner used D pad controls and a behind the character camera perspective In Nintendo released Super Mario which is a game that set the standard for D platformers It let the player explore D environments with greater freedom than was found in any previous game in the genre With this in mind Nintendo put an analog control stick on its Nintendo controller a feature that had not been seen since the Vectrex but which has since become standard The analog stick provided the fine precision needed with a free perspective In most D platformers the player finished a level by following a path to a certain point but in Super Mario the levels were open and had objectives Completing objectives earned the player stars and stars were used to unlock more levels This approach allowed for more efficient use of large D areas and rewarded the player for exploration but it meant less jumping and more action adventure Even so a handful of boss levels offered more traditional platforming Until then there was no settled way to make D platformers but Super Mario inspired a shift in design Later D platformers like Banjo Kazooie Spyro the Dragon and Donkey Kong borrowed its format and the collect a thon genre began to form In order to make this free roaming model work developers had to program dynamic intelligent cameras A free camera made it harder for players to judge the height and distance of platforms making jumping puzzles more difficult Some of the more linear D platformers like Tork Prehistoric Punk and Wario World used scripted cameras that limited player control Games with more open environments like Super Mario and Banjo Kazooie used intelligent cameras that followed the player s movements Still when the view was obstructed or not facing what the player needed to see these intelligent cameras needed to be adjusted by the player In the s RPGs first person shooters and more complex action adventure games captured significant market share Even so the platformer thrived Tomb Raider became one of the bestselling series on the PlayStation along with Insomniac Games Spyro and Naughty Dog s Crash Bandicoot one of the few D games to stick with linear levels Moreover many of the Nintendo s bestsellers were first and second party platformers like Super Mario Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong On Windows and Mac Pangea Software s Bugdom series and BioWare s MDK proved successful Several developers who found success with D platformers began experimenting with titles that despite their cartoon art style were aimed at adults Examples include Rare s Conker s Bad Fur Day Crystal Dynamics s Gex Deep Cover Gecko and Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver and Shiny Entertainment s Messiah In Sega produced a D Sonic game Sonic Adventure for its Dreamcast console It used a hub structure like Super Mario but its levels were more linear fast paced and action oriented Into the st century Nintendo launched its GameCube console without a platformer However it released Super Mario Sunshine in the second D Mario platformer Other notable D platformers trickled out during this generation Maximo was a spiritual heir to the Ghosts n Goblins series Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg offered Yuji Naka s take on a Mario influenced platformer Argonaut Software returned with a new platformer named Malice games such as Dragon s Lair D Return to the Lair and Pitfall The Lost Expedition were attempts to modernise classic video games of the s using the D platformer genre Psychonauts became a critical darling based on its imaginative levels and colorful characters and several franchises that debuted during the sixth generation of consoles such as Tak Ty the Tasmanian Tiger and Ape Escape each developed a cult following In Europe specifically the Kao the Kangaroo and Hugo series achieved popularity and sold well Rayman s popularity continued though the franchise s third game was not as well received as the first two Oddworld Munch s Oddysee brought the popular Oddworld franchise into the third dimension but future sequels to this game did not opt for the D platform genre Naughty Dog moved on from Crash Bandicoot to Jak and Daxter a series that became less about traditional platforming with each sequel A hybrid platformer shooter game from Insomniac Games called Ratchet Clank further pushed the genre away from such gameplay as did Universal Interactive Studios rebooted Spyro trilogy and Microsoft s attempt to create a mascot for the Xbox in Blinx The Time Sweeper Ironically Microsoft later found more success with their take on the genre Voodoo Vince In Crackpot Entertainment released Insecticide Crackpot composed of former developers from LucasArts for the first time combined influences from the point and click genre LucasArts had been known for on titles such as Grim Fandango with a platformer The platformer remained a vital genre but it never regained its old popularity Part of the reason for the platformer s decline in the s was a lack of innovation compared to other genres Platformers were either aimed at younger players or designed to avoid the platform label In platformers had a share of the market and an even higher share in their prime Four years later that figure had dropped to Even the acclaimed Psychonauts saw modest sales at first leading publisher Majesco Entertainment to withdraw from high budget console games though its sales in Europe were respectable Recent developments In the seventh generation of consoles despite the genre having a smaller presence in the gaming market some platformers found success In late Super Mario Galaxy and Ratchet Clank Future Tools of Destruction were received well by both critics and fans Super Mario Galaxy was awarded the Best Game of by high profile gaming websites like GameSpot IGN and GameTrailers At that point according to GameRankings it was the most critically acclaimed game of all time In LittleBigPlanet paired traditional D platformer gameplay with physics simulation and user created content earning it strong sales and good reviews Electronic Arts released Mirror s Edge which coupled platformer gameplay with a first person perspective although they did not market the game as a platformer because of the association of the label with games made for kids Sonic Unleashed featured stages with both D and D platformer gameplay a formula used later in Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations Moreover two Crash Bandicoot platformers were released in and and in RobTop Games an indie developer made Geometry Dash The popularity of D platformers rose in the s Nintendo revived the genre New Super Mario Bros was released in and sold million copies worldwide making it the best selling game for the Nintendo DS and the fourth best selling non bundled video game of all time Super Mario Galaxy eventually sold over eight million units while Super Paper Mario Super Mario DS Sonic Rush Yoshi s Island DS Kirby Super Star Ultra and Kirby Squeak Squad also sold well After the success of New Super Mario Bros there was a spate of D platformers These ranged from revivals like Bionic Commando Rearmed Contra ReBirth Sonic the Hedgehog and Rayman Origins to original titles like Splosion Man and Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure Wario Land The Shake Dimension released in was a D platformer with a rich visual style Later games like Limbo Super Meat Boy Braid Geometry Dash A Boy and His Blob and The Behemoth s BattleBlock Theater also used D graphics New Super Mario Bros Wii is especially notable because unlike most D platformers in the twenty first century it came out for a non portable console and was not restricted to a content delivery network A year after the success of New Super Mario Bros Wii Nintendo released more D platformers in their classic franchises Donkey Kong Country Returns and Kirby s Return to Dream Land In they released two more D platformers New Super Mario Bros for the DS and New Super Mario Bros U for the Wii U Nintendo also experimented with D platformers that had gameplay elements from D platformers leading to Super Mario D Land for the DS and Super Mario D World for the Wii U the latter having cooperative multiplayer Both were critical and commercial successes Besides Nintendo s games indie games in the late s and the s helped grow the platform game market Indie platformers had a stronger focus on story and innovation In independent developer Frozenbyte released Trine a D platformer that mixed traditional elements with modern physics puzzles The game sold more than million copies and a sequel Trine came out in The year saw the release of several D platformers leading the media to speculate about a revival of the genre These included Yooka Laylee and A Hat in Time both crowdfunded on the website Kickstarter Super Mario Odyssey which returned the series to the open ended gameplay of Super Mario became one of the best selling and best reviewed games in the franchise s history Super Lucky s Tale and an HD remaster of Voodoo Vince came out for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One Snake Pass was called a puzzle platformer without a jump button The Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy for PlayStation sold over million copies in three months despite some critics noting it was harder than the original games The next few years saw more remakes of D platformers Spyro Reignited Trilogy and SpongeBob SquarePants Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated In the ninth generation of consoles the platformer remains important Astro Bot Rescue Mission a PlayStation VR game was followed by Astro s Playroom which came pre installed on every PlayStation Sackboy A Big Adventure developed by Sumo Digital was a PlayStation launch title Crash Bandicoot It s About Time was released to critical praise Bowser s Fury a short campaign added to the Switch port of Super Mario D World bridged the gap between the gameplay of D World and that of Odyssey Ratchet Clank Rift Apart was one of the first PlayStation exclusive games made by Insomniac On August the Kickstarter funded Psychonauts was released to critical acclaim Fall Guys amalgamates platforming elements into the battle royale genre and was a critical and commercial success Subgenres This list some definable platformers in the following types but there are also many vaguely defined subgenres games that have not been listed These game categories are the prototypes genre that recognized by different platform styles Puzzle platformer Puzzle platformers are characterized by their use of a platformer structure to drive a game whose challenge is derived primarily from puzzles Enix s release Door Door and Sega s release Doki Doki Penguin Land for the SG are perhaps the first examples though the genre is diverse and classifications can vary Doki Doki Penguin Land allowed players to run and jump in typical platform fashion but they could also destroy blocks and were tasked with guiding an egg to the bottom of the level without letting it break The Lost Vikings was a popular game in this genre It has three characters players can switch between each with different abilities All three characters are needed to complete the level goals This subgenre has a strong presence on handheld systems Wario Land moved the Wario series into the puzzle platform genre by eliminating the element of death and adding temporary injuries such as being squashed or lit on fire and specialized powers Wario Land continued this tradition while Wario Land was more of a mix of puzzle and traditional platform elements The Game Boy update of Donkey Kong was also successful and saw a sequel on Game Boy Advance Mario vs Donkey Kong Klonoa Empire of Dreams the first handheld title in its series is also a puzzle platformer Through independent game development this genre has experienced a revival since Braid uses time manipulation for its puzzles and And Yet It Moves uses frame of reference rotation In contrast to these side scrollers Narbacular Drop and its successor Portal are first person games that use portals to solve puzzles in D Since the release of Portal there have been more puzzle platformers which use a first person camera including Purity and Tag The Power of Paint In Nintendo released Captain Toad Treasure Tracker which uses compact level design and camera rotation in order to reach the goal and find secrets and collectibles Despite lacking jump ability Toad still navigates the environment via unique movement mechanics Run and gun platformer The run and gun platform genre was popularised by Konami s Contra Among the most popular games in this style are Gunstar Heroes and Metal Slug Side scrolling run and gun games marry platformers with shoot em ups with less tricky platforming and more shooting These games are sometimes called platform shooters The genre has arcade roots so these games are generally linear and difficult There are games which have a lot of shooting but do not fall in this subgenre Mega Man Metroid Ghosts n Goblins Vectorman Jazz Jackrabbit Earthworm Jim Turrican Cuphead and Enchanted Portals are all platformers with shooting but unlike Contra or Metal Slug platforming as well as exploring and back tracking figures prominently Run and gun games are generally pure and while they may have vehicular sequences or other shifts in style they have shooting throughout Cinematic platformer Cinematic platformers are a small but distinct subgenre usually distinguished by their relative realism These games focus on fluid lifelike movements without the unnatural physics found in nearly all other platformers To achieve this realism many cinematic platformers beginning with Prince of Persia have employed rotoscoping techniques to animate their characters based on video footage of live actors performing the same stunts Jumping abilities are typically roughly within the confines of an athletic human s capacity To expand vertical exploration many cinematic platformers feature the ability to grab onto ledges or make extensive use of elevator platforms As these games tend to feature vulnerable characters who may die as the result of a single enemy attack or by falling a relatively short distance they almost never have limited lives or continues Challenge is derived from trial and error problem solving forcing the player to find the right way to overcome a particular obstacle Prince of Persia was the first cinematic platformer and perhaps the most influential Impossible Mission pioneered many of the defining elements of cinematic platformers and is an important precursor to this genre Other games in the genre include Flashback and its remake Another World Heart of Darkness the first two Oddworld games Blackthorne Bermuda Syndrome Generations Lost Heart of the Alien Weird Dreams Limbo Inside onEscapee Deadlight The Way and Lunark Tomb Raider was the first cinematic platformer to utilize real time D graphics Comical action game Games in the genre are most commonly called comical action games CAGs in Japan The original arcade Mario Bros is generally recognized as the originator of this genre though Bubble Bobble is also highly influential These games are characterized by single screen non scrolling levels and often contain cooperative two player action A level is cleared when all enemies on the screen have been defeated and vanquished foes usually drop score bonuses in the form of fruit or other items CAGs are almost exclusively developed in Japan and are either arcade games or sequels to arcade games though they are also a common genre among amateur doujinshi games Other examples include Don Doko Don Snow Bros and Nightmare in the Dark Isometric platformer Isometric platformers present a three dimensional environment using two dimensional graphics in isometric projection The use of isometric graphics was popularized by Sega s arcade isometric shooter Zaxxon which Sega followed with the arcade isometric platformer Congo Bongo released in February Another early isometric platformer the ZX Spectrum game Ant Attack was later released in November Knight Lore an isometric sequel to Sabre Wulf helped to establish the conventions of early isometric platformers This formula was repeated in later games like Head Over Heels and Monster Max These games were generally heavily focused on exploring indoor environments usually a series of small rooms connected by doors and have distinct adventure and puzzle elements Japanese developers blended this gameplay style with that of Japanese action adventure games like The Legend of Zelda to create games like Land Stalker and Light Crusader This influence later traveled to Europe with Adeline Software s sprawling epic Little Big Adventure which blended RPG adventure and isometric platforming elements Before consoles were able to display true polygonal D graphics the isometric perspective was used to move some popular D platformers into three dimensional gameplay Spot Goes To Hollywood was a sequel to the popular Cool Spot and Sonic D Blast was Sonic s outing into the isometric subgenre Platform adventure game Many games fuse platformer fundamentals with elements of action adventure games such as The Legend of Zelda or with elements of RPGs Typically these elements include the ability to explore an area freely with access to new areas granted by either gaining new abilities or using inventory items Many D games in the Metroid and Castlevania franchises are among the most popular games of this sort and so games that take this type of approach are often labeled as Metroidvania games Castlevania Symphony of the Night popularized this approach in the Castlevania series Other examples of such games include Hollow Knight both games in the Ori series Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps Wonder Boy III The Dragon s Trap Tails Adventure Cave Story Mega Man ZX Shadow Complex DuckTales Remastered Early examples of free roaming side scrolling D platform adventures in the vein of Metroidvania include Nintendo s Metroid in and Konami s Castlevania games Vampire Killer in and Simon s Quest in The Goonies II in again by Konami as well as Enix s sci fi Sharp X computer game Brain Breaker in Pony Canyon s Super Pitfall in System Sacom s Euphory in Bothtec s The Scheme in and several Dragon Slayer action RPGs by Nihon Falcom such as the release Xanadu and releases Faxanadu and Legacy of the Wizard Auto runner games Auto runner games are platformers where the player character is nearly always moving in one constant direction through the level with less focus on tricky jumping but more on quick reflexes as obstacles appear on screen The subcategory of endless runner games have levels that effectively go on forever typically through procedural generation Auto runner games have found success on mobile platforms because they are well suited to the small set of controls these games require often limited to a single screen tap for jumping Game designer Scott Rogers named side scrolling shooters like Scramble and Moon Patrol and chase style gameplay in platformers like Disney s Aladdin bit version and Crash Bandicoot as forerunners of the genre B C s Quest for Tires has elements of runner games keeping the jumping of Moon Patrol but replacing the vehicle with a cartoon character In February Gamevil published Nom for mobile phones in Korea The game s designer Sin Bong gu stated that he wanted to create a game that was only possible on mobile phones therefore he made the player character walk up walls and ceilings requiring players to turn around their mobile phones while playing To compensate for this complication he limited the game s controls to a single button and let the character run automatically and indefinitely like the people in modern society who must always look forward and keep running While the concept thus was long known in Korea journalists credit Canabalt as the title that single handedly invented the smartphone friendly single button running genre and spawned a wave of clones Fotonica a one button endless runner viewed from the first person that was described as a hybrid of Canabalt s running Mirror s Edge s perspective and hands and Rez s visual style Temple Run and its successor Temple Run were popular endless running games The latter became the world s fastest spreading mobile game in January with million installations within thirteen days See also List of platform game
