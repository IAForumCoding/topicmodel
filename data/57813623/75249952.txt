presented awards or introduced trailers All other awards were presented by Keighley or Goodman Performers The following individuals or groups performed musical numbers Pedro Eustache who became known as Flute Guy during the ceremony returned to perform as part of the Game Awards Orchestra Reception Nominees Some journalists were surprised by Cyberpunk s four nominations twice as many as its original nominations in particularly due to the game s troubled launch Many considered Destiny s Best Community Support nomination poorly timed coming weeks after layoffs at developer Bungie including much of its community team Journalists felt several performances were overlooked and suggested Best Performance be split to consider leading and supporting performances to widen its scope TheGamer s Stacey Henley found Pizza Tower s nomination for Best Debut Indie Game but not Best Independent Game incongruous The absence of nominations for Chained Echoes was highlighted as a flaw in the eligibility period for games released the preceding December some writers opined the show had a recency bias with half the Game of the Year nominees released in October Many reporters and players highlighted the sole nomination for Starfield a blockbuster game from a reputable developer though some found it appropriate due to the game s lesser quality compared to its competition The lack of nominations for Hogwarts Legacy was similarly highlighted with some citing the game s divisiveness as a possible reason though others felt it was due to its relative quality Some lamented the omission of Octopath Traveler and others felt Final Fantasy XVI was snubbed a Game of the Year nomination Several journalists and viewers expressed confusion at Dave the Diver s Best Independent Game nomination as its developer Mintrocket is a subsidiary of the larger company Nexon which previously claimed the game was not necessarily an indie TheGamer s Henley wrote that Baldur s Gate was technically an entirely independent game but was likely not considered eligible due to developer Larian Studios s employee count and use of an existing intellectual property In response Keighley said independent can mean different things to different people and opted to allow the jury to decide the final selections TheGamer s Jade King called Games for Impact a locker to stuff all the diverse games into with four of its six nominees not receiving any other nominations and felt it was typically limited to independent games despite others fitting the criteria Ceremony Before the ceremony more than game industry members including previous Future Class recipients more than half of the members to date signed an open letter calling for a statement to be read during the show addressing the ongoing Gaza humanitarian crisis supporting the rights of Palestinians and calling for a ceasefire and asking the industry to address the dehumanization of people from South West Asia and North Africa and their portrayal as villains or terrorists in games The letter s author Future Class recipient Youn s Rabii said it was motivated by Meg Jayanth s withdrawal as a presenter at the Golden Joystick Awards in October after being barred from making a statement about Palestinians The Mary Sue s Ana Valens bemoaned the show s lack of response and Paste s Garrett Martin criticized it as cowardly Rock Paper Shotgun s Alice Bell felt the show only would have voiced support if it was a profitable stance rather than a moral one After the ceremony developers of nominees Goodbye Volcano High and Venba said they had planned to acknowledge the crisis in their acceptance speeches Keighley spoke with Future Class members after the show some members felt he was deflective and unprepared while others found the meeting productive and hopeful The ceremony was criticized for prioritizing announcements and celebrity guests over nominees and winners Some journalists felt this was represented by actor Timoth e Chalamet presenting Game of the Year instead of a game developer Obsidian Entertainment director Josh Sawyer called the show an embarrassing indictment of a segment of the industry desperate for validation via star power with little respect for the devs it s supposedly honoring Eurogamer s Chris Tapsell felt future ceremonies should mirror the goals of its own industry rather than seek validation and relevance from others Video Games Chronicle s Andy Robinson empathized with the production team s challenges and considered the show among the best to date but felt it suffered from runtime and curation problems VentureBeat s Dean Takahashi felt the show lived up to the reputation of being the Oscars of gaming Some commentators considered highlights included Old Gods of Asgard s performance and Abubakar Salim announcing Tales of Kenzera Zau in memory of his late father Journalists found it disrespectful that celebrity guests were given several minutes to speak including more than six minutes for Hideo Kojima and Jordan Peele while winners were allocated thirty seconds before being prompted to wrap it up and cut off by music and others were relegated to the preshow or announced in quick succession without acceptance speeches The Escapist s Liam Nolan calculated that winners speeches cumulatively ran for less than minutes compared to the Academy Awards s minute average Commentators cited Best Performance winner Neil Newbon being cut off while talking about players heartfelt responses to his work and Game of the Year acceptee Swen Vincke while paying tribute to his deceased colleague and found it disrespectful considering several acceptees speak English as a second language Keighley said he asked his team to relax the rule during the show and acknowledged it would be addressed in future GameSpot and IGN published speeches from winners who were unable to accept at the show Critics bemoaned the show s lack of acknowledgement of the video game industry s mass layoffs VentureBeat s Rachel Kaser found it particularly disappointing considering the show s focus on film and television industry professionals and The Verge s Ash Parrish wrote that Keighley let video game developers down Dot Esports s Issy van der Velde called it disappointing but not entirely unexpected based on the show s history of avoiding acknowledgment Game Developer s Chris Kerr criticized Keighley s opening speech for calling for unity but failing to address layoffs and felt the show should spend less time chasing a hollow sense of legitimacy by curating a showcase that has the cultural awareness and humanity of a shameless Super Bowl ad The ceremony was picketed by pro worker protestors advocating for unionization including members of the Game Workers of Southern California and SAG AFTRA one picket sign read best year for games worst year for game workers Some Call of Duty developers criticized presenter Christopher Judge s joke that his acceptance speech was lengthier than Call of Duty Modern Warfare III s single player story campaign Current and former developers countered by citing Call of Duty s higher commercial success though some deleted their responses and said they respected God of War in which Judge portrays Kratos Barry Sloane who portrays Modern Warfare s Captain Price similarly criticized Judge s joke but later wrote all s fair in games and war and complimented his performances Sledgehammer Games s Darcy Sandall found Judge s joke unexpected from a peer at an event that sic supposed to be celebrating this year s achievements in gaming particularly in light of reports regarding its development involving crunch Viewership An estimated million viewers watched the ceremony the most in the show s history and a increase from the previous year More than content creators co streamed the event including over on Twitch a increase and on YouTube On Twitch the show peaked at million concurrent viewers and saw a increase in total
