Microsoft Windows is a product line of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Microsoft It is grouped into families and sub families that cater to particular sectors of the computing industry Windows unqualified for a consumer or corporate workstation Windows Server for a server and Windows IoT for an embedded system Defunct families include Windows x Windows Mobile Windows Phone and Windows Embedded Compact The first version of Windows was released on November as a graphical operating system shell for MS DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces GUIs Windows is the most popular desktop operating system in the world with a market share as of March according to StatCounter However Windows is not the most used operating system when including both mobile and desktop OSes due to Android s massive growth As of the most recent version of Windows is Windows for consumer PCs and tablets Windows Enterprise for corporations and Windows Server for servers Still supported are some editions of Windows Windows Server and later and exceptionally with paid support down to Windows Server and Windows Embedded POSReady Product line As of the only active top level family is Windows NT The first version Windows NT was intended for server computing and corporate workstations It grew into a product line of its own and now consists of four sub families that tend to be released almost simultaneously and share the same kernel Windows unqualified For a consumer or corporate workstation or tablet The latest version is Windows Its main competitors are macOS by Apple for personal computers and iPadOS and Android for tablets c f Usage share of operating systems Market share by category Of note Windows refers to both the overall product line and to this sub family of it Windows Server For a server computer The latest version is Windows Server Unlike its client sibling it has adopted a strong naming scheme The main competitor of this family is Linux c f Usage share of operating systems Market share by category Windows PE A lightweight version of its Windows sibling meant to operate as a live operating system used for installing Windows on bare metal computers especially on many computers at once recovery or troubleshooting purposes The latest version is Windows PE Windows IoT previously Windows Embedded For IoT and embedded computers The latest version is Windows IoT Enterprise Like Windows Server the main competitor of this family is Linux c f Usage share of operating systems Market share by category These top level Windows families are no longer actively developed Windows x Intended for the consumer market only The first version of this family was Windows which was followed by Windows The last version of the Windows x family was Windows Me which PC World called it as one of the worst products of all time labeling it as Mistake Edition and placing it th in their list of Worst Tech Products in All versions of this family have a monolithic kernel that uses MS DOS as a foundation along with the kernel first used with Windows Microsoft now caters to the consumer market with Windows NT starting with Windows XP Windows Mobile The predecessor to Windows Phone a mobile phone and PDA operating system The first version was called Pocket PC The third version Windows Mobile was the first version to adopt the Windows Mobile trademark The last version was Windows Mobile Windows Phone Sold only to smartphone manufacturers The first version was Windows Phone followed by Windows Phone and Windows Phone It was succeeded by Windows Mobile which is also discontinued Windows Embedded Compact Most commonly known by its former name Windows CE it is a hybrid kernel operating system optimized for low power and memory systems with OEMs able to modify the UI to suit their needs The final version was Windows Embedded Compact and it is succeeded by Windows IoT Version history The term Windows collectively describes any or all of several generations of Microsoft operating system products These products are generally categorized as follows Early versions The history of Windows dates back to when Microsoft started work on a program called Interface Manager It was announced in November after the Apple Lisa but before the Macintosh under the name Windows but Windows was not released until November Windows was to compete with Apple s operating system but achieved little popularity Windows is not a complete operating system rather it extends MS DOS The shell of Windows is a program known as the MS DOS Executive Components included Calculator Calendar Cardfile Clipboard Viewer Clock Control Panel Notepad Paint Reversi Terminal and Write Windows does not allow overlapping windows Instead all windows are tiled Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows Microsoft sold as included Windows Development libraries with the C development environment which included numerous windows samples Windows was released in December and was more popular than its predecessor It features several improvements to the user interface and memory management Windows changed the OS from tiled windows to overlapping windows The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple s copyrights eventually settled in court in Microsoft s favor in Windows also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and could make use of expanded memory Windows was released in two different versions Windows and Windows Windows uses the virtual mode of the Intel to multitask several DOS programs and the paged memory model to emulate expanded memory using available extended memory Windows in spite of its name runs on both Intel and Intel processors It runs in real mode but can make use of the high memory area In addition to full Windows packages there were runtime only versions that shipped with early Windows software from third parties and made it possible to run their Windows software on MS DOS and without the full Windows feature set The early versions of Windows are often thought of as graphical shells mostly because they ran on top of MS DOS and used it for file system services However even the earliest Windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions notably having their own executable file format and providing their own device drivers timer graphics printer mouse keyboard and sound Unlike MS DOS Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time through cooperative multitasking Windows implemented an elaborate segment based software virtual memory scheme which allows it to run applications larger than available memory code segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control Windows x Windows released in improved the design mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers VxDs that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi tasked DOS applications Windows applications can run in protected mode which gives them access to several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme They run inside the same address space where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection Windows also featured improvements to the user interface Microsoft rewrote critical operations from C into assembly Windows was the first version of Windows to achieve broad commercial success selling million copies in the first six months Windows made generally available on March featured a facelift In August Windows for Workgroups a special version with integrated peer to peer networking features and a version number of was released It was sold along with Windows Support for Windows ended on December Windows released in is an updated version of the Chinese version of Windows The update was limited to this language version as it fixed only issues related to the complex writing system of the Chinese language Windows was generally sold by computer manufacturers with a ten disk version of MS DOS that also had Simplified Chinese characters in basic output and some translated utilities Windows x The next major consumer oriented release of Windows Windows was released on August While still remaining MS DOS based Windows introduced support for native bit applications plug and play hardware preemptive multitasking long file names of up to characters and provided increased stability over its predecessors Windows also introduced a redesigned object oriented user interface replacing the previous Program Manager with the Start menu taskbar and Windows Explorer shell Windows was a major commercial success for Microsoft Ina Fried of CNET remarked that by the time Windows was finally ushered off the market in it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world Microsoft published four OEM Service Releases OSR of Windows each of which was roughly equivalent to a service pack The first OSR of Windows was also the first version of Windows to be bundled with Microsoft s web browser Internet Explorer Mainstream support for Windows ended on December and extended support for Windows ended on December Windows was followed up with the release of Windows on June which introduced the Windows Driver Model support for USB composite devices support for ACPI hibernation and support for multi monitor configurations Windows also included integration with Internet Explorer through Active Desktop and other aspects of the Windows Desktop Update a series of enhancements to the Explorer shell which was also made available for Windows In May Microsoft released Windows Second Edition an updated version of Windows Windows SE added Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player amongst other upgrades Mainstream support for Windows ended on June and extended support for Windows ended on July On September Microsoft released Windows Me Millennium Edition the last DOS based version of Windows Windows Me incorporated visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT based counterpart Windows had faster boot times than previous versions which however required the removal of the ability to access a real mode DOS environment removing compatibility with some older programs expanded multimedia functionality including Windows Media Player Windows Movie Maker and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras additional system utilities such as System File Protection and System Restore and updated home networking tools However Windows Me was faced with criticism for its speed and instability along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support PC World considered Windows Me to be one of the worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released and the fourth worst tech product of all time Windows NT Version history Early versions Windows NT In November a new development team within Microsoft which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft s OS operating system known as NT OS NT OS was intended to be a secure multi user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures However following the successful release of Windows the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended bit port of the Windows API known as Win instead of those of OS Win maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel Following its approval by Microsoft s staff development continued on what was now Windows NT the first bit version of Windows However IBM objected to the changes and ultimately continued OS development on its own Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel The hybrid kernel was designed as a modified microkernel influenced by the Mach microkernel developed by Richard Rashid at Carnegie Mellon University but without meeting all of the criteria of a pure microkernel The first release of the resulting operating system Windows NT named to associate it with Windows was released in July with versions for desktop workstations and servers Windows NT was released in September focusing on performance improvements and support for Novell s NetWare and was followed up by Windows NT in May which included additional improvements and support for the PowerPC architecture Windows NT was released in June introducing the redesigned interface of Windows to the NT series On February Microsoft released Windows a successor to NT The Windows NT name was dropped at this point in order to put a greater focus on the Windows brand Windows XP The next major version of Windows NT Windows XP was released to manufacturing RTM on August and to the general public on October The introduction of Windows XP aimed to unify the consumer oriented Windows x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT a change which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS based predecessors Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface including an updated Start menu and a task oriented Windows Explorer streamlined multimedia and networking features Internet Explorer integration with Microsoft s NET Passport services a compatibility mode to help provide backwards compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows and Remote Assistance functionality At retail Windows XP was marketed in two main editions the Home edition was targeted towards consumers while the Professional edition was targeted towards business environments and power users and included additional security and networking features Home and Professional were later accompanied by the Media Center edition designed for home theater PCs with an emphasis on support for DVD playback TV tuner cards DVR functionality and remote controls and the Tablet PC edition designed for mobile devices meeting its specifications for a tablet computer with support for stylus pen input and additional pen enabled applications Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April Extended support ended on April After Windows Microsoft also changed its release schedules for server operating systems the server counterpart of Windows XP Windows Server was released in April It was followed in December by Windows Server R Windows Vista After a lengthy development process Windows Vista was released on November for volume licensing and January for consumers It contained a number of new features from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes with a particular focus on security features It was available in a number of different editions and has been subject to some criticism such as drop of performance longer boot time criticism of new UAC and stricter license agreement Vista s server counterpart Windows Server was released in early Windows On July Windows and Windows Server R were released to manufacturing RTM and released to the public three months later on October Unlike its predecessor Windows Vista which introduced a large number of new features Windows was intended to be a more focused incremental upgrade to the Windows line with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible Windows has multi touch support a redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar with revealable jump lists that contain shortcuts to files frequently used with specific applications and shortcuts to tasks within the application a home networking system called HomeGroup and performance improvements Windows and Windows the successor to Windows was released generally on October A number of significant changes were made on Windows including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft s Metro design language with optimizations for touch based devices such as tablets and all in one PCs These changes include the Start screen which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch based devices The new Windows version required a minimum resolution of pixels effectively making it unfit for netbooks with pixel screens Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms such as social networks and Microsoft s own OneDrive formerly SkyDrive and Xbox Live services the Windows Store service for software distribution and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots An update to Windows called Windows was released on October and includes features such as new live tile sizes deeper OneDrive integration and many other revisions Windows and Windows have been subject to some criticism such as the removal of the Start menu Windows On September Microsoft announced Windows as the successor to Windows It was released on July and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows Changes on PC include the return of the Start Menu a virtual desktop system and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full screen mode Windows is said to be available to update from qualified Windows with SP Windows and Windows Phone devices from the Get Windows Application for Windows Windows or Windows Update Windows In February Microsoft announced the migration of its Windows source code repository from Perforce to Git This migration involved million separate files in a gigabyte repository By May percent of its engineering team was using Git in about commits and Windows builds per day In June shortly before Microsoft s announcement of Windows Microsoft updated their lifecycle policy pages for Windows revealing that support for their last release of Windows will end on October On April Microsoft announced that version H would be the last of Windows Windows On June Windows was announced as the successor to Windows during a livestream The new operating system was designed to be more user friendly and understandable It was released on October As of May Windows is a free upgrade to Windows users who meet the system requirements Windows In July Microsoft announced it will start selling subscriptions to virtualized Windows desktops as part of a new Windows service in the following month The new service will allow for cross platform usage aiming to make the operating system available for both Apple and Android users It is a separate service and offers several variations including Windows Frontline Windows Boot and the Windows app The subscription service will be accessible through any operating system with a web browser The new service is an attempt at capitalizing on the growing trend fostered during the COVID pandemic for businesses to adopt a hybrid remote work environment in which employees split their time between the office and home As the service will be accessible through web browsers Microsoft will be able to bypass the need to publish the service through Google Play or the Apple App Store Microsoft announced Windows availability to business and enterprise customers on August Multilingual support Multilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel Components for all supported input languages such as Input Method Editors are automatically installed during Windows installation in Windows XP and earlier files for East Asian languages such as Chinese and files for right to left scripts such as Arabic may need to be installed separately also from the said Control Panel Third party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs Since Windows English editions of Windows NT have East Asian IMEs such as Microsoft Pinyin IME and Microsoft Japanese IME bundled but files for East Asian languages may be manually installed on Control Panel Interface languages for the operating system are free for download but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows Language Interface Packs LIPs are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft s Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows XP or later they translate most but not all of the Windows interface and require a certain base language the language which Windows originally shipped with This is used for most languages in emerging markets Full Language Packs which translate the complete operating system are only available for specific editions of Windows Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and and all editions of Windows and RT except Single Language They do not require a specific base language and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center but are available as optional updates through the Windows Update service except Windows The interface language of installed applications is not affected by changes in the Windows interface language The availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves Windows and Windows Server introduce a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed and language packs regardless of type can be downloaded from a central location The PC Settings app in Windows and Windows Server R also includes a counterpart settings page for this Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled Windows Store apps such as Mail Maps and News and certain other Microsoft developed apps such as Remote Desktop The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language which caters to emerging markets Platform support Windows NT included support for several platforms before the x based personal computer became dominant in the professional world Windows NT and its predecessors supported PowerPC DEC Alpha and MIPS R although some of the platforms implement bit computing the OS treated them as bit Windows dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x known as IA or newer in bit mode The client line of the Windows NT family still ran on IA up to Windows with Windows dropping support IA was already dropped from Windows Server releases since Windows Server R With the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture IA Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it Itanium versions of Windows XP and Windows Server were released at the same time as their mainstream x counterparts Windows XP Bit Edition Version released in is the last Windows client operating system to support Itanium Windows Server line continues to support this platform until Windows Server Windows Server R is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture On April Microsoft released Windows XP Professional x Edition and Windows Server x editions to support x or simply x the bit version of x architecture Windows Vista was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA and x editions As of x is still supported An edition of Windows known as Windows RT was specifically created for computers with ARM architecture and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows tablets with Windows RT will not be updated Starting from Windows Fall Creators Update version and later includes support for ARM based PCs Windows CE Windows CE officially known as Windows Embedded Compact is an edition of Windows that runs on minimalistic computers like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated kernel dubbed Windows CE kernel Microsoft licenses Windows CE to OEMs and device makers The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences while Windows CE provides the technical foundation to do so Windows CE was used in the Dreamcast along with Sega s own proprietary OS for the console Windows CE was the core from which Windows Mobile was derived Its successor Windows Phone was based on components from both Windows CE R and Windows CE Windows Phone however is based on the same NT kernel as Windows Windows Embedded Compact is not to be confused with Windows XP Embedded or Windows NT Embedded modular editions of Windows based on Windows NT kernel Xbox OS Xbox OS is an unofficial name given to the version of Windows that runs on Xbox consoles From Xbox One onwards it is an implementation with an emphasis on virtualization using Hyper V as it is three operating systems running at once consisting of the core operating system a second implemented for games and a more Windows like environment for applications Microsoft updates Xbox One s OS every month and these updates can be downloaded from the Xbox Live service to the Xbox and subsequently installed or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC It was originally based on NT Windows kernel and the latest version runs on an NT base This system is sometimes referred to as Windows on Xbox One Xbox One and Xbox Series operating systems also allow limited due to licensing restrictions and testing resources backward compatibility with previous generation hardware and the Xbox s system is backwards compatible with the original Xbox Version control system Up to and including every version before Windows Microsoft used an in house version control system named Source Library Manager SLM Shortly after Windows was released Microsoft switched to a fork of Perforce named Source Depot This system was used up until once the system could not keep up with the size of Windows Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into Team Foundation Server in but Windows and Office continued to rely on Source Depot The Windows code was divided among different repositories with a kind of virtualization layer to produce unified view of all of the code In Microsoft announced that it would start using Git an open source version control system created by Linus Torvalds and in May they reported that the migration into a new Git repository was complete VFSForGit Because of its large decades long history however the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of Linux development that Git was originally created to manage Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the whole repository takes several hours Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git VFSForGit to address these challenges In the VFS for Git has been superseded by Scalar Timeline of releases Usage share and device sales Use of Windows has exceeded Windows globally since early For desktop and laptop computers according to Net Applications and StatCounter which track the use of operating systems in devices that are active on the Web Windows was the most used operating system family in August with around usage share according to Net Applications and around usage share according to StatCounter Including personal computers of all kinds e g desktops laptops mobile devices and game consoles Windows OSes accounted for of usage share in August compared to Android highest at iOS s iPadOS s and macOS s according to Net Applications and of usage share in August compared to Android highest at iOS iPadOS s and macOS s according to StatCounter Those statistics do not include servers including cloud computing where Linux has significantly more market share than Windows as Net Applications and StatCounter use web browsing as a proxy for all use Security Early versions of Windows were designed at a time where malware and networking were less common and had few built in security features they did not provide access privileges to allow a user to prevent other users from accessing their files and they did not provide memory protection to prevent one process from reading or writing another process s address space or to prevent a process from code or data used by privileged mode code While the Windows x series offered the option of having profiles for multiple users with separate profiles and home folders it had no concept of access privileges allowing any user to edit others files In addition while it ran separate bit applications in separate address spaces protecting an application s code and data from being read or written by another application it did not protect the first megabyte of memory from userland applications for compatibility reasons This area of memory contains code critical to the functioning of the operating system and by writing into this area of memory an application can crash or freeze the operating system This was a source of instability as faulty applications could accidentally write into this region potentially corrupting important operating system memory which usually resulted in some form of system error and halt Windows NT was far more secure implementing access privileges and full memory protection and while bit programs meeting the DoD s C security rating yet these advantages were nullified by the fact that prior to Windows Vista the default user account created during the setup process was an administrator account the user and any program the user launched had full access to the machine Though Windows XP did offer an option of turning administrator accounts into limited accounts the majority of home users did not do so partially due to the number of programs which required administrator rights to function properly As a result most home users still ran as administrator all the time These architectural flaws combined with Windows s very high popularity made Windows a frequent target of computer worm and virus writers Furthermore although Windows NT and its successors are designed for security including on a network and multi user PCs they were not initially designed with Internet security in mind as much since when it was first developed in the early s Internet use was less prevalent In a strategy memo entitled Trustworthy computing sent to every Microsoft employee Bill Gates declared that security should become Microsoft s highest priority Windows Vista introduced a privilege elevation system called User Account Control When logging in as a standard user a logon session is created and a token containing only the most basic privileges is assigned In this way the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system When logging in as a user in the Administrators group two separate tokens are assigned The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive User applications including the Windows shell are then started with the restricted token resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account When an application requests higher privileges or Run as administrator is clicked UAC will prompt for confirmation and if consent is given including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group start the process using the unrestricted token Leaked documents from to codenamed Vault detail the capabilities of the CIA to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare such as the ability to compromise operating systems such as Windows In August computer experts reported that the BlueKeep security vulnerability CVE that potentially affects older unpatched Windows versions via the program s Remote Desktop Protocol allowing for the possibility of remote code execution may include related flaws collectively named DejaBlue affecting newer Windows versions i e Windows and all recent versions as well In addition experts reported a Microsoft security vulnerability CVE based on legacy code involving Microsoft CTF and ctfmon ctfmon exe that affects all Windows versions from Windows XP to the then most recent Windows versions a patch to correct the flaw is available Microsoft releases security patches through its Windows Update service approximately once a month usually the second Tuesday of the month although critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary Versions subsequent to Windows SP and Windows XP implemented automatic download and installation of updates substantially increasing the number of users installing security updates Windows integrates the Windows Defender antivirus which is seen as one of the best available Windows also implements Secure Boot Control Flow Guard ransomware protection BitLocker disk encryption a firewall and Windows SmartScreen File permissions All Windows versions from Windows NT have been based on a file system permission system referred to as AGDLP Accounts Global Domain Local Permissions in which file permissions are applied to the file folder in the form of a local group which then has other global groups as members These global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions used This system varies from other vendor products such as Linux and NetWare due to the static allocation of permission being applied directly to the file or folder However using this process of AGLP AGDLP AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders Alternative implementations Owing to the operating system s popularity a number of applications have been released that aim to provide compatibility with Windows applications either as a compatibility layer for another operating system or as a standalone system that can run software written for Windows out of the box These include Wine a free and open source implementation of the Windows API allowing one to run many Windows applications on x based platforms including UNIX Linux and macOS Wine developers refer to it as a compatibility layer and use Windows style APIs to emulate Windows environment CrossOver a Wine package with licensed fonts Its developers are regular contributors to Wine Proton A fork of Wine by Valve to run Windows games on Linux and other Unix like OS ReactOS an open source OS intended to run the same software as Windows originally designed to simulate Windows NT later aiming at Windows compatibility It has been in the development stage since See also References External links Official website Official Windows Blog Archived January at the Wayback Machine Microsoft Developer Network Archived January at the Wayback
