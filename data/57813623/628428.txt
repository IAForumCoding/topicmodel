blog The PC Gamer blog was started to coincide with the transfer of the PC Gamer UK site to become part of the Computer and Video Games network which incorporates all of Future plc s gaming magazines The move brought some controversy with many long standing members of the forum leaving due to the new forum s cramped spacing advertising and slow loading times The introduction of a blog was seen as one of the redeeming features of the switch The blog has since been regularly updated with contributions from many of the magazine s staff The topics discussed range from the controversy over violent video games to the benefits of buying a PC over a console In PC Gamer re launched their website and blog by bringing together the online communities of both the US and UK magazines into one website As a result the PC Gamer blog now has contributions from both the US and UK magazines all hosted at the new website along with the forums for both magazines Podcast The PC Gamer UK podcast started on May and ran episodes until its final episode which was released on July It had a rotating cast made up of members of the staff including Chris Thursten Tom Senior Graham Smith Tom Francis and Marsh Davies

to week Previously monthly the podcast was recorded every fortnight Participants discussed the games they had been playing and news from the industry and answered questions submitted via Twitter The

featuring one of their editors To access the features of the CD including the demos patches and reviews the user had to navigate a basement which played very much like classic PC games such as Myst It was in this game sequence that the magazine s mascot Coconut Monkey was introduced just as the editor was leaving the magazine marking the transition from the FMV demo CDs to the more contemporary menu driven demo CDs that were subsequently used The cover disc of the July issue of the Slovenian Swedish and UK editions of PC Gamer were infected with the Marburg virus which CNN Money stated caused the malware to become a widespread threat In the September edition of PC Gamer it was announced that they would be dropping the demo disk altogether and concentrating on improving the quality
