which takes place in a zero gravity dimension where the player controls a ship through various environments with mission objectives that must be completed to advance to the next area The player is given a debriefing before each level that explains the mission for the level and explains additional objectives that can be completed for extra points These objectives usually involve destroying a power generator destroying or activating a computer terminal or eradicating alien presence from a vital area The game is divided into three episodes Theta Vengeance and The Void each with levels and one hidden bonus level per episode Theta was released as a shareware episode The Radix ship has three basic health units armor shields and energy The shields protect the ship s armor and will take damage from enemy fire or wall collisions The player loses a life once the ship s armor is depleted The player can increase their flying speed either by using a throttle or by using afterburners to fly at maximum speed Energy is required for the use of afterburners as well as certain weapons The ship s energy and shields regenerate slowly on their own but can be refilled to the max by finding a powerup The player will encounter a variety of enemy alien ships and fodder that will shoot at the player Bio mines will try to detonate on player s ship and will do massive damage Some enemies will shoot missiles both standard as well as seeking missiles which will lock onto and follow the player s ship The Radix ship has a radar scanner which will display enemy positions in relation to the fighter There is also a threat indicator which will light up when an enemy missile has locked onto the ship A variety of power ups can be found in each level that will help the player fight enemies increase health or give the player a certain ability for a limited amount of time There are seven different types of weapons available to the Radix with only four available in the first episode Some weapons require the ship s energy to use while others are arsenal based Plasma bombs can also be acquired which will deal massive damage to any enemy visible on the screen when detonated A single plasma bomb can wipe out an entire room of weaker enemies There are various environmental hazards such as missile walls teleports gravitational disturbances that will hinder alter movement and moving walls floors that can damage or kill the player After a mission s primary objective is completed the player must find their way to the exit door to advance to the next area Release Versions and use game controls where the player s ship is always moving forward at a slow speed and is not possible to stop or fly backwards Version was released at the beginning of and fixed a few elements such as tightening navigation controls to make it easier to bank up down and also increasing the durability of the ship so as not to take significant damage from minor things like touching a wall The first two levels of episode were also significantly modified The REMIX patch was released in late and introduced a number of new features A few levels were modified most notably the boss levels The game controls are significantly reworked the player s vehicle will hover in place until any of the separate forward backward or strafe controls are used Afterburners still require energy to use but can boost speed in any direction Enemies are much harder to sneak up on as they will detect the player s presence once they are within scanner range regardless of walls or barriers between them Defeated enemies will leave debris behind The threat indicator will also light up when standard missiles have been fired by an enemy as well as seeking missiles The screen will also flash blue instead of red when a player s shields take damage and flash red only when the shields are depleted and their armor takes damage Version also fixes a programming glitch from all previous versions in episode where if the player finds and completes the hidden level the game will skip over level completely and go straight to level Reception Jon Mavor the main programmer of Neural Storm Entertainment has said the game didn t sell well and didn t really make any money References External links Epic MegaGames page Radix Beyond the Void at MobyGames Radix Beyond the Void shareware
