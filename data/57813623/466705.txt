Game types Assault This game type is played with two teams one assaulting a base and the other defending it The map is set up with objectives which the attacking team must complete usually in sequence such as shutting down a power generator or entering an area The team who first attacks then defends and attempts to defend for the entire time they attacked If they accomplish this they win If the team defending first assaults the base faster than the other team they win If both teams defend for the maximum amount of time the match is a tie The Dreamcast version does not feature this mode Capture the Flag Players compete to capture the other team s flag and return it to their base Competitive teams must use a great deal of teamplay Both teams must defend the base from incoming attackers and get into the other team s base take their flag and return to base Deathmatch A classic every man for himself player vs player combat The objective is to out kill all opposing players Domination Two teams compete to control various control points to earn points Standard maps contain three control points Control of these points is initially accomplished through occupation physically occupying the space but control of a point continues until a player from another team occupies the space The first team to reach the point limit or that has the most points when a time limit has expired wins Last Man Standing Similar to Deathmatch the player s objective is to remain alive longer than their opponents putting an emphasis on number of deaths rather than kills Players start with all weapons except the Redeemer fully loaded and have a set number of lives Power ups including health and ammunition packs are unavailable Once a player runs out of lives they lose Team Deathmatch Up to four teams compete to out kill the opposing teams Four bonus packs were released each adding maps characters or features For example Bonus Pack adds relics as mutators Relics are special items that grant a significant advantage to their holder They include but are not limited to the Relic of Vengeance which creates an explosion when its holder dies the Relic of Regeneration which regenerates the health of the holder and the Relic of Redemption which makes its holder respawn elsewhere with full health and weapons intact when they would normally die Bonus Pack adds a new version of Xan Kriegor Plot During the Human Skaarj war the New Earth Government was formed Mining was the primary method of financing the war but was unpopular with the working class who grew weary of the working conditions and the war The humans were losing the war and riots broke out The Terran system was surrounded by Skaarj forces but a government team destroyed their mothership and the Skaarj withdrew Afterward revolts and violence among the mining colonies were on the increase and efforts to deal with them were unsuccessful The government then came up with the idea of giving the violence an outlet instead Consensual murder was legalized in the year enabling people to fight to the death under organized conditions The Liandri Mining Corporation worked with the government and organized leagues and public exhibitions Soon these matches became more profitable than mining and Liandri formed a professional league to compete in a Grand Tournament the most popular event in the sport The game takes place in fifty years after the fights were first legalized Development With a budget of million using lines of C and UnrealScript Unreal Tournament took around a year and a half to develop When Unreal the first installment of the Unreal series was released in May it was well received by the press but it soon became apparent that the quality of the network code used for multiplayer matches was hampering the game s further success In the months following Unreal s release improving the game s multiplayer part became the top priority of the development team Epic Games started considering an official expansion pack intended to improve the network code while also featuring new maps and other gameplay elements The team began work on the expansion in summer but the task became complicated by Epic s organizational structure During the development of Unreal the team members at Digital Extremes were working in Ontario Canada while the members at Epic were based in North Carolina United States requiring regular travel to Ontario To remedy this Epic decided to centralize the teams in Raleigh North Carolina and by September work on the expansion could begin Lead programmer Steve Polge set about laying the foundations for the new game types such as Capture the Flag and Domination and level designers created the first round of maps for testing The content grew quickly and soon the team realized that it had underestimated the task In November after a meeting with publisher GT Interactive Mark Rein suggested releasing the work as a stand alone game instead of an expansion The team was reticent at first but soon accepted the idea and in December the game became known internally as Unreal Tournament Edition The development team for Unreal Tournament consisted of around people Most team members had worked on Unreal though Epic hired a number of new developers to reinforce the team Programmer Brandon Reinhart was one such hire joining Epic in August to help with the support of Unreal and the development of Unreal Tournament That December Reinhart discovered an Unreal mod called UBrowser which provided a new user interface for finding multiplayer matches After showing it to James Schmalz the lead designer at Digital Extremes Schmalz decided to hire the mod s author Jack Porter After only a few weeks Porter was already working with the team replacing the game s existing menu system with his new interface Epic founder Tim Sweeney worked on improving the networking code along with Steve Polge who also wrote code for AI player physics and general gameplay Erik de Neve was responsible for the LOD character rendering and various extra optimizations During the game s development the team lacked artists The art director at Epic Games Shane Caudle and the artists at Digital Extremes could not make enough new textures because of the amount of diversity in characters and maps To help with the skin and texture production Epic contracted Steve Garofalo The game s level and content management program UnrealEd was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy but no one had time to fix it The game engine had an object oriented design and the scripting language UnrealScript was considered to be more like Java The modularity of the object oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and D Studio Max All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem The soundtrack for the game which employed the system of module files was written by Alexander Brandon Michiel van den Bos Andrew Sega Dan Gardopee Peter Hajba and Tero Kostermaa Unreal Tournament had support for the EAX Version D positional audio technology by Creative Labs and A D HRTF technology by Aureal Semiconductor out of the box In Epic Games released a playable demo on September This version of the demo was only compatible with Glide based accelerators An updated demo version with support for OpenGL and Direct D cards was released on September Unreal Tournament went gold became ready for release on November shipping a few days later on November The Mac version went gold on December The Dreamcast version was developed by Secret Level who had to drop Assault mode along with many larger maps due to the Dreamcast having insufficient memory Linux port of Unreal Tournament was also in development The goal of the project was to improve the quality of the Linux port of the game as well as strengthen the mod authoring community and teach Epic about open source projects In Loki Software made an exclusive agreement with Epic Games to maintain and support the Linux version of Unreal Tournament offering new features addressing any technical issues and achieving revision parity with the Windows version Bonus Pack was released on February Unreal Tournament was re released in fall autumn as Unreal Tournament Game of the Year Edition which includes the first three bonus packs and mods such as Rocket Arena a one on one combat mode Reception In the United States alone Unreal Tournament sold copies by the end of

barrier in the speed running mayhem of Assault mode battling back and forth amongst the alleyways of Domination or dropping shrapnel shells at people s feet with the wonderfully chunky flak cannon in a fast and furious free for all deathmatch Unreal Tournament was an endless source of entertainment In Unreal Tournament was inducted into the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame Unreal Tournament was
