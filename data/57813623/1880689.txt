but predominately featured is the Lancer Assault Rifle which has a mounted chainsaw bayonet that can deal melee damage at close range Playable characters can carry two primary weapons grenades and a smaller secondary weapon such as the Snub Pistol Weapons are reloaded with a tap of the RB button and a second tap within a given time active reload rewards the player with a damage bonus However

settings in the first game From easiest to hardest these are Casual Hardcore and Insane The Insane difficulty is unlocked once the game is beaten on either the Casual or Hardcore difficulty Multiplayer Gears of War features up to four on four competitive gameplay with teams representing the Gears or the Locust Players must execute downed foes otherwise these will revive after a time In Assassination matches the team s leader is the only one that can track the other team s leader and pick up new weapons after which teammates can pick them up with the goal to eliminate the foe s leader An Xbox patch added the Annex mode which is similar to King of the Hill in which players must try to control a shifting control point for a certain amount of time to win The PC version of Gears introduced King of the Hill a mode not present in the Xbox version which uses a fixed control point but varies the conditions on which it is controlled Synopsis Setting and characters Gears of War takes place on the planet Sera A liquid called Imulsion became a highly valued power source after a scientist discovered how to use it and the economic shockwave led to several wars between nations The Coalition of Ordered Governments COG originally existed only as an obscure world government philosophy but it evolved into a legitimate though minor political party during the year long Pendulum Wars The soldiers of the COG are called Gears After Emergence Day E Day when the Locust began their attack on humanity the COG were the ones who took the necessary steps to ensure the survival of human civilization instituting martial law and taking charge of the effort against the Locust Fourteen years later the COG is the only human government left on Sera One year after E Day after losing multiple military battles to the Locust the COG launched a Pyrrhic tactical and strategic campaign using the satellite based weapon of mass destruction known as the Hammer of Dawn on human cities with extremely destructive results The result gave the citizens of Sera three days to evacuate to the Jacinto Plateau the only place Locust could not dig through before going through with the attack The game primarily focuses on Marcus Fenix John DiMaggio and his comrades in Delta Squad Dominic Dom Santiago Carlos Ferro Augustus Cole Lester Speight and Damon Baird Fred Tatasciore Side characters such as Colonel Victor Hoffman Private Anthony Carmine Lieutenant Minh Young Kim Lieutenant Anya Stroud and an elderly Stranded man known as Chaps also aid Delta Squad throughout the narrative The game s main antagonist is General RAAM a powerful leader of the Locust Horde s armed forces Players take control of Fenix in the campaign while in co op mode the second player controls Santiago All four Delta squad members are available for play during multiplayer games along with Carmine Kim and Hoffman in addition to various Locust characters Plot The game s plot begins years after Emergence Day E Day when the Locust Horde overran and killed many COG soldiers and civilians declaring war against humanity Marcus Fenix a former COG soldier is reinstated into the military after spending four years in prison for deserting his military post in order to make a vain attempt to save his father Adam Fenix Dominic Dom Santiago Marcus best friend and fellow COG successfully extracts Fenix from the prison and takes him to meet Delta Squad The group seeks to obtain the resonator a device that will map The Hollow the caverns which the Locust inhabit and later deploy the Lightmass Bomb which will destroy the heart of the Locust forces inside the Hollow Fenix and his allies recover the device but suffer multiple casualties in the process including Anthony Carmine and Squad leader Kim Fleeing RAAM s forces Fenix leads the remaining soldiers through the ruins of Ephyra to claim a Junker APC drive to a mining facility and finally into the planet s depths Delta Squad successfully detonates the resonator but the device fails to map enough of the tunnel network They discover a larger map of the network that originates from Fenix s old home specifically his father s laboratory The group ventures to the Fenix estate at East Barricade Academy where Fenix originally attempted to rescue his father When they arrive Delta encounters heavy Locust resistance After collecting the data the group fights their way past Locust forces and boards a train carrying the Lightmass Bomb Fenix and Santiago battle their way through the train and are able to kill General RAAM before uploading the data Fully activated the Lightmass Bomb launches into the Hollow and eradicates the Locust tunnel networks In the game s final sequence Hoffman delivers a victory speech as the tunnels collapse and explode whereupon the voice of the Locust Queen promises that the Locust will continue to fight onward despite their losses Development Design The first concept for the game was conceived around the years and as Unreal Warfare which was much closer to the multiplayer driven Unreal series than the game that would eventually become Gears of War The original concept for the game featured character classes and mechs being played in a closed arena against other players or bots The game was put on standby as Epic focused on the Unreal Tournament series and when the team went back to it the industry had shifted towards single player games and the aim of the game was changed According to Rod Fergusson the game was at one point intended to be a horror game influenced by Band of Brothers Resident Evil and Kill Switch A romance subplot was considered for the game but was eventually dropped In an interview with Cliff Bleszinski lead developer for Epic Games he cites three games that were the primary influences in the game s design including the pacing and over the shoulder third person perspective from Resident Evil and the tactical cover system from Kill Switch Bleszinski also cited Bionic Commando s influence on the cover system equating the actions of moving from cover to cover as similar to the action of swinging from platform to platform in the latter game These design choices reflect themselves in the gameplay as Gears of War focuses mainly on squad team based and cover dependent tactics with limited weapons rather than brute force Bleszinski also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda including its storytelling and world building elements acquiring and mastering of tools and underground environments The game s title itself is a homage to Metal Gear an early formative influence on Bleszinski The total cost of development was million according to Epic s Mark Rein and to people were involved with the development at any time However these figures do not include the proprietary Unreal Engine Gears of War was first shown as an unnamed exclusive for the Xbox in a behind closed doors presentation by Epic Games at the Game Developers Conference The demo was presented as a technology showcase for Unreal Engine that would run on the Xenon processor at the center of the new Xbox It showcased a group of human soldiers patrolling a city at night that fell under ambush The demo was noted for its overall realism suspense and visual clarity helping to reinforce the argument advanced by Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney for Microsoft to double the memory in the Xbox from the planned MB to MB This decision that would ultimately cost Microsoft tens of millions of dollars and restrict the number of Xbox consoles available at launch but allowed Gears of War and many other Xbox games to run at p resolution Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski said he hoped for the game to expand into graphic novels and eventually film On November Microsoft Corporate VP of Global Marketing and Interactive Entertainment Business Jeff Bell stated Gears of War is the first in a trilogy through sequences on E Day and the battle of Jacinto Plateau as well as information on Adam Fenix and his research Epic Games Vice President Mark Rein posted a message on the official Gears of War Internet forums stating It s not over until it is not fun anymore and in his view Gears of War may become the next Halo series in terms of popularity The ending to Gears of War heavily suggested a sequel and at the Game Developers Conference Bleszinkski confirmed that Epic Games did intend to do a sequel to Gears of War The game s sequel Gears of War was officially confirmed on February and was released at midnight on November On January Microsoft announced that they have acquired all rights to the franchise from Epic Games and that Rod Fergusson had rejoined Microsoft Studios to lead development on future Gears of War games Ports News of the franchise s future has emerged multiple times since the game s release PC Gamer accidentally released an image in its holiday issue where Gears of War can be seen in a Games for Windows display which led to suspicion that Gears of War would be released for the PC however the image was later stated to be a mock up Possible leaked pictures were released on February leading to more suspicion of Gears on the PC In an interview with Xbox fan site TeamXbox Mark Rein stated that the game would eventually come to the PC Epic was not currently ready to release it on that format but the upcoming release of Unreal Tournament was helping Epic get optimization on the PC On July at the E conference it was revealed that Gears of War would indeed be released for Windows New features include three new multi player maps an extension of five new single player chapters to act five which describes events of Delta Squad escaping a giant Brumak between acts four and five which Mark Rein claims is about percent extra over the existing Xbox content new game modes a game editor and Games for Windows Live support integrated into Unreal Engine When asked about bringing the additional content to the Xbox version Mark Rein of Epic Games stated that it is unlikely we will bring that content to He then states Unfortunately the version it s built on is not really compatible with the and so it would involve a massive patch a patch larger than all five we ve done so far to Gears of War to do that Additionally the PC and Xbox versions will not allow for cross platform play Cliff Bleszinski stated that while this feature does add value it just wasn t that desired nor worth the extra months of design and development time We want Gears of War to be out this holiday on PC This news angered many owners of Gears of War on the Xbox due to the game no longer living up to its Exclusively for the Xbox title and not receiving the additional content Mark Rein noted that despite their original label of the game as an Xbox exclusive Microsoft allowed them to develop the game as part of the Games for Windows moniker as has been done previously with Halo A patch was released on November to fix performance issues and also the Games for Windows Live update issue The patch was only released for American and Western European versions of the game legitimate purchasers of the Eastern European and Russian versions were informed that the game would continue to function without the patch and never issued a corresponding version A macOS version was confirmed by Mark Rein at the end of E on the Game Head television program on July along with Unreal Tournament but no release time frame was specified As of August nothing more has been mentioned Digital certificate issue In early an issue with a digital certificate used to sign certain game critical files as part of the anti cheat mechanism which expired on January rendered the game unplayable without a temporary workaround of resetting the system clock to before the certificate expired Initial information from sources led people to believe the issue was related to DRM within the game Epic later acknowledged the problem claiming it was not in relation to a form of DRM but instead to a form of Anti Cheat and notified end users that they were working with Microsoft to get it resolved This issue was corrected as of February with a downloadable patch Music The music was composed by Kevin Riepl who has previously worked with Epic Games on the soundtracks for Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship The Liandri Conflict Riepl began receiving early builds and cinematics about halfway through the development process closely collaborating with the development team on the influence the music should have on the player and the story The theme of Destroyed Beauty that had inspired the game s visuals guided the music too creating mood suited to a beautiful city in ruins and the emotional desperation of its inhabitants The score includes many mechanical percussive elements altered samples of explosions hits and impacts and electric guitar stingers that punctuate the game s combat encounters To complete the score these elements were combined with the organic sounds of a live orchestra The orchestral score was orchestrated and conducted by Corey Status and performed by the Northwest Sinfonia orchestra The title track was written and performed by thrash metal band Megadeth with an instrumental version of the song being used for the soundtrack a revised version with lyrics was featured on the band s album United Abominations Megadeth performed the track live as headliners of Gigantour a twenty five stop metal tour sponsored by Microsoft as part of the promotion for the game A soundtrack was released on July by Sumthing Else Music Works Ultimate Edition During a press conference at E Microsoft announced a remaster of Gears of War entitled Gears of War Ultimate Edition It brought about a number of improvements including updates to the gameplay from later titles and enhanced graphics featuring remodeled characters environmental assets and other stylistic changes It was subsequently released worldwide for the Xbox One in North America and Asian Pacific countries on August and in Europe on August and Microsoft Windows on March Marketing Promotional videos Microsoft produced a thirty minute documentary titled Gears of War The Race to E that aired on MTV on May to promote the game The program was produced in a reality TV style and featured Cliff Bleszinski Epic Games president Mike Capps and producer Rod Fergusson in the weeks leading up to the Gears of War gameplay reveal at the Xbox Media Briefing at E The program captures several stressful moments including Xbox executive Peter Moore s desire to remove the chainsaw rifle from the E demo days before the show The chainsaw remained and after the demo was given Bill Gates confided to Cliff I love that chainsaw The Gears of War television ad reveals Marcus Fenix alone in the ruined streets of Sera as he moves to avoid threats that appear throughout a dark and deserted city The spot was widely praised and has been described as one of the most iconic game trailers of the s The spot set to the Gary Jules cover of Mad World and directed by Joseph Kosinski is melancholic and reflective in tone and was a significant departure for videogame advertising at the time especially a fast paced shooter game According to Kosinski David Fincher was slated to direct the ad but had to drop out from a scheduling conflict leading to Kosinski being brought on to direct Visual effects company Digital Domain created the visuals inside the Unreal Engine game engine the same engine that powered Gears of War on the Xbox While the spot was pre rendered the production method gave consumers an accurate preview of the game s textures and subtle facial expressions The popularity of the commercial built a bigger audience for Mad World which would reach the spot on iTunes five years after it was initially recorded The melody remains heavily associated with the Gears of War franchise and was later adopted into the soundtrack of Gears of War Bleszinski said in that he chose the song as it was his anthem at the time to cope with the failure of his first marriage Limited Collector s Edition At the game s release Epic Games released a Limited Collectors Edition Some of the notable differences are a steel case instead of the regular plastic case and an extra disc which contains artworks of environments and stages including Locust that did not made it to the game and extra content and behind the scenes footage of the making of Gears of War The disc also contains a time lapse on the creation of the Emergence mural The game s disc and case has a different cover and instead features the Omen background Another of the Collector s Edition extras is a book titled Destroyed Beauty which illustrates the game s back story and includes concepts sketches and descriptions of the game s characters The Collector s Edition also includes the same instruction manual and hour Xbox Live Gold trial as the regular game does Downloadable content Epic Games began working on new content for Gears of War in August The updates would remain free according to Epic Games president Mike Capps The first of these updates was released over Xbox Live on January with two new maps released the following day on January The two maps reflected background scenes from the game s storyline known as Raven Down and Old Bones which depict Gears fighting Locust amidst the crash site of a King Raven chopper and a museum Another update was released for Gears of War on January which according to Epic Games Marc Rein is said to fix some compatibility issues with the release of Gears of War in Japan and that no game play or functionality features were changed On April Epic Games released their third update containing a new game mode titled Annex which requires teams to capture and hold certain areas of each map as well as additional gameplay tweaks and fixing up some glitches bugs and exploits The update was free of charge Epic Games initially said that four new maps would be released in conjunction with the third patch However due to disagreements between Microsoft and Epic Games Epic decided instead to put these maps on sale at a reasonable price then make them free a few months later according to Mark Rein of Epic Games The map pack titled Hidden Fronts was released on Xbox Live Marketplace on May and included the maps Bullet Marsh Garden Process and Subway Free downloads of these maps were made available on September four months after their initial release A fourth update on June added additional Achievement points bringing the total possible achievement points to in eight Achievements related to Annex mode and the maps from Hidden Fronts Additionally the update includes improvement of roadie run to keep the player from sticking to cover areas and a patch to prevent the Annex clock from counting during connection errors Other housekeeping issues were also addressed Reception Critical Upon

praised the game for its concept visuals presentation and sound IGN s review of the game called it the most gorgeous looking game on the Xbox and that the sound design is worthy of awards While the game received high praise reviewers did point out that Gears of War did not offer anything significantly new in its core gameplay Eurogamer s review of the game states let s not pretend that we re wallowing in the future of entertainment What we have here is an extremely competent action game that s as polished and refined as it could be and is therefore very enjoyable But if Epic had applied the same widescreen scope and ambition to the gameplay as it did to the engine we d be much more excited than we are The game s story was noted for not being very deep as GameSpot s review states The lack of exposition feels like a missed opportunity to make the characters and the setting even more compelling The PC release of the game received similar praise as the version with reviewers noting various differences between the two versions IGN commented that The mouse and keyboard allow for more precise control and the graphics have been improved as well however UP stated that the control scheme s a very central obstacle to the game GameSpot noted that the additional chapter felt out of place as it changes things up a bit in ways that betray the difficulty progression of the game Hyper s Cam Shea commends the game for its visual solid gameplay killer multiplayer and reload mechanics However he criticised it for potential frustration pointless squad commands and chainsaw mechanics The Lancer weapon was later featured in an Electronic Gaming Monthly article that discusses its practicality and historical precedents Keirsey criticized this weapon by noting that in real life chainsaws are heavy He noted that the closest historical precedents are medieval bludgeoning weapons Awards Leading up to the game s release Gears of War was one of the most anticipated games of The
