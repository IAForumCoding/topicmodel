and safety guidelines changes due to COVID in California Keighley wanted the show to be more cinematic opting for a shorter duration than previous years around hours in response to viewer feedback he felt viewers encountered fatigue with previous shows and worked to streamline by cutting some content Keighley struggled with the balance between awards and announcements noting that industry members

participation worldwide and featuring an exclusive gameplay sequence of the upcoming game Dead Space it was broadcast in locations in the United States and Canada where tickets became available on

Camila Gormaz The Game Bakers co founder Audrey Leprince and Global Game Jam president Dr JC Lau The show added an award for Best Adaptation recognizing media adapted from video games including films television shows novels comic books and podcasts Keighley felt the popularization of adaptations led to them passing the minimum threshold of nominees and it was time to honor them The Game Awards partnered with Discord to present Best Community Support and introduce voting and guest events in the show s Discord server Announcements Keighley estimated the show involved over games about to of which are announced games showing new content The first clip of The Super Mario Bros Movie was revealed during the show Announcements on released and upcoming games were made for New games announced included Several fans and journalists expressed frustration by the lack of Xbox announcements during the event IGN s Ryan McCaffrey called it a slap in the face to players Some theorized the company s absence may be due to the Federal Trade Commission announcing it would attempt to block Microsoft s acquisition of Activision Blizzard in the morning of the show though journalists noted it was likely unrelated Aaron Greenberg vice president of Xbox Games Marketing responded to the complaints by stating the company had announcements planned for Stage interruption After Elden Ring was announced as the Game of the Year winner a male individual followed the developers on stage and waited while they gave their speech As music began to play after director Hidetaka Miyazaki s speech the individual approached the microphone and said I want to thank everybody and say I think I want to nominate sic this award to my Reformed Orthodox sic rabbi Bill Clinton sic in a thick Israeli accent During the second speech The Washington Post observed Keighley waving for security security escorted the individual off stage and Keighley ended the show as planned Minutes later Keighley said the individual had been arrested the Los Angeles Police Department later said no arrest was made but the individual had been detained and questioned at the venue by on site police and security before being transported to a local police station The event received immediate attention by news outlets and on social media a model of Clinton was modded into Elden Ring Several journalists criticized the ambush and noted it presented potential danger to the Elden Ring developers and overshadowed their award The Game Awards digitally removed the individual when sharing an image of Miyazaki s speech on Twitter Subsequent reports identified the individual as a year old who had premeditated the stunt with his friends Reports emerged that he had a history of publicly expressing support for the Hong Kong protests at NBA matches and BlizzCon in and had appeared twice on InfoWars an American far right talk show whose host Owen Shroyer described him as one of the young stars of the conservative movement He spoke without an accent during these appearances The individual s InfoWars appearance and choice of shoewear at The Game Awards Adidas Yeezy by Kanye West who had recently made multiple antisemitic public statements led to speculation that his interruption was promoting antisemitic tropes In subsequent interviews he refused to break character but claimed to be Jewish said to have recently attained an Israeli accent denied being a fan of InfoWars and disagreed with West s political views He claimed his statement wasn t intended to be a dog whistle for far right conspiracies Journalists described him as a troll prankster and shitposter Bloomberg News s Jason Schreier said the individual was almost certainly a Jewish prankster based on his understanding of Hebrew Digital Trends s Giovanni Colantonio found the moment a poetic representation of the show itself a fan overshadowing the people who we were supposed to be celebrating The incident led to increased security the following year Winners and nominees Nominees were announced on November Any game released for public consumption on or before November was eligible for consideration The nominees were compiled by a jury panel composed of members from over media outlets globally including specialized juries for accessibility adaptation and esports awards media outlets for general nominees jury members for accessibility and outlets for esports Winners were determined between the jury percent and public voting percent the latter was held via the official website and Discord server until December According to Keighley public voting within the first hours increased percent compared to The Game Awards within the first week million votes had been submitted more than double in the same period the previous year and exceeding s total three week count When the polls closed more than million votes had been submitted an increase of percent over Keighley felt the competition was particularly rife between the two flagship games Elden Ring and God of War Ragnar k Christopher Judge s Best Performance acceptance speech ran for minutes and seconds exceeding the longest Oscar speech set in by Greer Garson by two and a half minutes The exception to the jury voted awards is Players Voice fully nominated and voted on by the public the winner was determined after three rounds of voting which ran from November to December The final two rounds of Players Voice voting led to accusations of bribery and bots as some users suspected Genshin Impact players were voting in hopes of receiving in game currency and erroneously suggested the game had offered some to players who voted for it while some Genshin Impact players accused Sonic Frontiers fans of using bots to vote Several journalists reported a lack of credible evidence of bots or bribery and Keighley felt bots were uninvolved but said his team would investigate Discourse surrounding the voting became adversarial with fandoms attacking each other and the subreddit r SonicTheHedgehog restricting posts about the award Some users reported the website only allowed them to vote for either Genshin Impact or Sonic Frontiers Keighley jokingly referenced bot accusations when crowning Genshin Impact the winner during the show PC Gamer s Mollie Taylor noticed adversarial discourse remained on both sides after the event Genshin Impact distributed in game currency to all players after its win Keighley said the discourse reaffirmed the show s decision to avoid fully public voting for main categories Awards Winners are listed first highlighted in boldface and indicated with a double dagger Video games and media Esports and creators Games with multiple nominations and awards Multiple nominations God of War Ragnar k led the show with eleven nominations tied for the most in the show s history It was followed by Elden Ring with eight and Horizon Forbidden West and Stray with seven Sony Interactive Entertainment led the publishers with nominations followed by Annapurna Interactive with and Nintendo with In addition to video game publishers Netflix received three nominations for its television productions in Best Adaptation Multiple awards God of War Ragnar k led the show with six wins followed by Elden Ring with four and Final Fantasy XIV and Stray with two each Sony Interactive won a total of seven awards followed by Bandai Namco Entertainment and Nintendo with four each Presenters and performers Presenters The following individuals listed in order of appearance presented awards or introduced trailers All other awards were presented by Keighley or Goodman Performers The following individuals or groups performed musical numbers Ratings and reception Nominees Several journalists and viewers were surprised to see Xenoblade Chronicles nominated for several awards particularly Game of the Year due to previous snubs of the Japanese role playing game genre GamesRadar s Jordan Gerblick called it the show s dark horse nomination Elden Ring s Best Narrative nomination received mixed responses with some praising the subtle storytelling and others noting the game lacked a good or proper narrative The A V Club s William Hughes felt nominating Elden Ring alongside the traditional storytelling of God of War Ragnar k and untraditional Immortality was just begging for the whole exercise to fall apart Several journalists considered Sifu s Best Fighting Game nomination inappropriate as it is an action game Players s Jonas Hoeger criticized Best Mobile Game nominees Diablo Immortal Genshin Impact and Tower of Fantasy due to their manipulative microtransactions systems and Best Multiplayer Game nominee Overwatch for its problematic early access launch He felt Best Family Game had become outweighed by Nintendo games and its title was not representative of its nominees some of which are single player games Destructoid s Eric Van Allen praised the nominations of Citizen Sleeper and Vampire Survivors PC Gamer s Andy Chalk felt Immortality was overlooked for Best Independent Game and the Best Sim Strategy Game category may need reworking due to the weird grouping of games like Mario Rabbids Sparks of Hope Two Point Campus and Victoria TheGamer s Eric Switzer named Ghostwire Tokyo Hardspace Shipbreaker and Sonic Frontiers the biggest snubs and wrote the eligibility period led to games like Pentiment and Somerville which released after the nominees were announced but before the cutoff date being overlooked VentureBeat s Mike Minotti thought Final Fantasy XIV Endwalker s soundtrack was snubbed likely due to its release in December and hoped Live a Live had received more nominations Game Rant s Aidan Connor felt new categories for roguelike and horror games were necessary to allow recognition for overlooked indie titles like Rogue Legacy and Signalis respectively Kotaku s Sisi Jiang found the Games for Impact category insulting both for assuming AAA games are not impactful and acting as a consolation award for indie games Den of Geek s John Saavedra felt the Game of the Year nominations of A Plague Tale Requiem and Stray represented a shift in the industry toward smaller games supported by It Takes Two s win in Inverse s Willa Rowe opined the line had blurred between independent and AA games and indie game had become more of a stylistic term than a measurable trait citing small budget independent games like Citizen Sleeper and I Was a Teenage Exocolonist being overlooked due to the popularity and higher budgets of indie publishers like Annapurna Interactive and Devolver Digital TheGamer s Stacey Henley similarly considered Stray s nominations unbalanced due to its marketing push by Sony and felt it exposed a flaw in the hierarchy of categories its Game of the Year nomination signified it would win the less prestigious Best Indie Game which in itself meant it would win Best Debut Indie Game TheGamer s Sean Murray considered A Plague Tale Requiem s Game of the Year nomination surprising calling the game a compelling sequel that was brought down by underutilized gameplay mechanics and a poor final act Similarly although she enjoyed the game VentureBeat s Rachel Kaser found Stray s nomination misplaced and thought Tunic would have been more appropriate Ceremony Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times criticized the show s return to a vacuum of marketing with little reference to ongoing events unlike Keighley s statement the previous year denouncing workplace harassment He enjoyed some of the moments that cut through the noise like Ken and Roberta Williams presenting Games for Impact and As Dusk Falls s director Caroline Marchal s subsequent winning speech Digital Trends s Colantonio similarly considered the lack of focus on awards disappointing and noticed the teleprompter asking winners to conclude their speeches almost instantaneously He cited a particularly disheartening moment in which Keighley announced winners of several important categories in rapid succession and in an instant and just as quickly aired a trailer for Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Nintendo Life s Zion Grassl felt the winners were rushed off stage too quickly Variety s Kaare Eriksen identified the show s increasing codependence with Hollywood despite its attempts to highlight the artistic validity of the medium citing Al Pacino s appearance the announcement of Idris Elba in Cyberpunk and the introduction of Best Adaptation won by Netflix The Washington Post s Shannon Liao reported the in person audience was visibly bored and some look sleepy in the show s final hour VentureBeat s Kaser called the event satisfying but predictable praising Pacino s appearance and Animal s banter with Bear McCreary The Guardian s Lewis Gordon and Keza MacDonald felt like previous years the ceremony continued to focus too heavily on announcements over awards of the winners were crowned between announcements and without acceptance speeches MacDonald wrote the show lacked a specific focus between awards and announcements which she felt sit uneasily together Gordon found some skits unenjoyable and trailers excessive and favored the unscripted moments for avoiding the show s otherwise commercial nature citing Christopher Judge s lengthy acceptance speech Kotaku s Claire Jackson similarly felt Judge stole the show and VentureBeat s Dean Takahashi described it as a beautiful moment Takahashi wrote the show had something for everyone and considered Hades II and Judas the biggest surprises Destructoid s Noelle Warner who attended the show as a seat filler found the impressive production value enhanced the atmosphere of announcements and performances though noted the event ran longer than planned Video Games Chronicle s Nathan Brown was shocked by his enjoyment of the show citing the announcements performances and winners though was disappointed by the focus on marketing over awards and the lack of attention towards indie games he recommended that future ceremonies drop Best Independent Game and expand other categories to better represent independent developers TechRadar s Cat Bussell lauded the fresh and unique quality of the games announced at the show but found the winners remained constrained by traditionalism despite their caliber Push Square s Sammy Barker thought the show reached its full potential praising the pacing running time reveals and balance between announcements and awards though questioned the necessity of categories like esports awards when they continue to receive little fanfare Similarly Dot Esports s Cale Michael felt esports categories were continually overlooked noting the winners were announced within seconds during the preshow whereas Judge s speech ran for around eight minutes Prior to the show Kotaku s Alyssa Mercante highlighted the poor fashion of previous Game Awards ceremonies as demonstrative of the industry s lack of representation The discourse garnered responses from Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser and Microsoft executive Phil Spencer and Mercante and other journalists recognized it led to an improvement in fashion at the show attendees receiving particular praise included Aurora Fuslie Hideo Kojima and Valkyrae Musician Pedro Eustache dubbed Flute Guy received media attention for his enthusiastic flute performance and ability to swap between instruments during the orchestra s Game of the Year medley Eustache who has performed with The Game Awards Orchestra since thanked the audience for their response and apologized for not using the shinobue during Xenoblade Chronicles s section of the medley Viewership An estimated million viewers watched the ceremony the most in the show s history to date and a

the stage interruption accounted for while the top three games mentioned were Elden Ring God of War Ragnar k and Hades II Keighley had previously felt the show would be the first to shrink in overall viewership after eight years of successive growth partly due to the easing of the COVID pandemic and the gradual waning interest in live streams Notes References External links Official website
