Sounds It was launched in to meet the demand for music generated by pirate radio stations when the average age of the UK population was The BBC claims that it targets the age group and the average age of its UK audience since is BBC Radio started hour broadcasting on May According to RAJAR the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of million with a listening share of as of March History First broadcast Radio was established in along with the more middle of the road BBC Radio as a successor to the BBC Light Programme which had broadcast popular music and other entertainment since Radio was conceived as a direct response to the popularity of offshore pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline and Radio London which had been outlawed by Act of Parliament The new service was initially promoted in the summer of by trails voiced by Kenny Everett which referred to it as Radio the station s temporary working title Radio was launched at am on Saturday September Broadcasts were on kHz AM metres using a network of transmitters which had carried the Light Programme Most were of comparatively low power at less than kilowatts leading to patchy coverage of the country The first disc jockey to broadcast on the new station was Tony Blackburn who had previously been on Radio Caroline and Radio London and presented what became known as the Radio Breakfast Show The first words on Radio after a countdown by the Controller of Radios and Robin Scott and a jingle recorded at PAMS in Dallas Texas beginning The voice of Radio were And good morning everyone Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio This was the first use of US style jingles on BBC radio but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio The reason jingles from PAMS were used was that the Musicians Union would not agree to a single fee for the singers and musicians if the jingles were made in house by the BBC they wanted repeat fees each time one was played The first music to be heard on the station was an extract from Beefeaters by Johnny Dankworth Theme One specially composed for the launch by George Martin was played for the first time before Radio officially launched at am The first complete record played on Radio was Flowers in the Rain by The Move the number record in that week s Top the number record The Last Waltz by Engelbert Humperdink would have been inappropriate for the station s sound The second single was Massachusetts by the Bee Gees The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio schedule with every change of breakfast show presenter generating considerable media interest The initial rota of staff included John Peel Pete Myers and a gaggle of others some transferred from pirate stations such as Keith Skues Ed Stewart Mike Raven David Ryder Jim Fisher Jimmy Young Dave Cash Kenny Everett Simon Dee Terry Wogan Duncan Johnson Doug Crawford Tommy Vance Chris Denning and Emperor Rosko Many of the most popular pirate radio voices such as Simon Dee had only a one hour slot per week Midday Spin s Initially the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who it is claimed disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with Radio and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations with some DJs such as Jimmy Young being in their s The very fact that it was part of an establishment institution such as the BBC was a turn off for some and needle time restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had It also had limited finances and often as in January suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives Despite this it gained massive audiences becoming the most listened to station in the world with audiences of over ten million claimed for some of its shows up to twenty million for some of the combined Radio and Radio shows In the early to mid s Radio presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids thanks to the Publicity Department s high profile work The touring summer live broadcasts called the Radio Roadshow usually as part of the BBC Radio Weeks promotions that took Radio and shows on the road drew some of the largest crowds of the decade The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition apart from Radio Luxembourg and from Manx Radio in the Isle of Man Independent Local Radio did not begin until October took many years to cover virtually all of the UK and was initially a mixture of music and talk Alan Freeman s Saturday Rock Show was voted Best Radio Show five years running by readers of a national music publication and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery News coverage on the station was boosted in when Newsbeat bulletins aired for the first time and Richard Skinner joined the station as one of the new programme s presenters On air was the busiest year of the decade David Jensen replaced Dave Lee Travis as host of the weekday drivetime programme so that DLT could replace Noel Edmonds as presenter of the Radio Breakfast show Later in the year the Sunday teatime chart show was extended from a Top countdown to a Top countdown and Tommy Vance one of the station s original presenters rejoined the station to present a new programme The Friday Rock Show and on November Radio moved from m kHz to m kHz medium wave as part of a plan to improve national AM reception and to conform with the Geneva Frequency Plan of Annie Nightingale whose first Radio programme aired on October was Britain s first national female DJ the earliest record presenter is thought to be Jean Metcalfe of Family Favourites but given that Metcalfe only presented the programme she is not considered a true DJ and became its longest serving presenter having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times In Al Matthews became the first black disc jockey to join Radio His Saturday night show Discovatin was broadcast for over two years During the summer months a Wednesday show was also broadcast featuring live acts s At the start of Mike Read took over The Radio Breakfast Show from Dave Lee Travis Towards the end of the year Steve Wright started the long running Steve Wright in the Afternoon show In the new Radio s Weekend Breakfast Show started initially with Tony Blackburn supported by Maggie Philbin and Keith Chegwin Adrian John and Pat Sharp also joined for the early weekend shows Gary Davies and Janice Long also joined hosting Saturday night late and evening shows respectively In Robbie Vincent joined to host a Sunday evening soul show Mike Smith left for a while to present BBC s Breakfast Time Gary Davies then took over the weekday lunchtime slot Bruno Brookes joined and replaced Peter Powell as presenter of the teatime show with Powell replacing Blackburn on a new weekend breakfast show In Radio relocated from its studios in Broadcasting House to Egton House In March Ranking Miss P became the first black female DJ on the station hosting a reggae programme In July Andy Kershaw also joined the station Simon Mayo joined the station in while Smith re joined to replace Read on the breakfast show In response to the growth in dance and rap music Jeff Young joined in October with the Big Beat show At the end of the year Nicky Campbell Mark Goodier and Liz Kershaw all joined and Janice Long left Mayo replaced Smith on the breakfast show in May In September Goodier and Kershaw took over weekend breakfasts with Powell departing Campbell took over weekday evenings as part of a move into night time broadcasting as October saw Radio extend broadcast hours until previously the station had closed for the night at midnight From September Radio began its FM switch on with further major transmitter switch ons in and It was not until the mid s that all existing BBC radio transmitters had Radio added Previously Radio had borrowed Radio s VHF FM frequencies for around hours each week s On May Radio began hour broadcasting although only on FM as the station s MW transmitters were switched off between midnight and In Radio for the first and only time covered a general election Their coverage was presented by Nicky Campbell In his last few months as controller Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under Matthew Bannister One of these Loud n proud was the UK s first national radio series aimed at a gay audience which was produced in Manchester and aired from August Far from being a parting quirk the show was a surprise hit and led to the network s first coverage of the large outdoor Gay Pride event in The Man Ezeke became Radio s first black regular daytime presenter when he began hosting on Sunday lunchtimes in January Bannister took the reins fully in October His aim was to rid the station of its Smashie and Nicey image in order to appeal to the under s Although originally launched as a youth station by the early s its loyal listeners and DJs had aged with the station over its year history Many long standing DJs such as Simon Bates Dave Lee Travis Alan Freeman Bob Harris Paul Gambaccini Gary Davies and later Steve Wright Bruno Brookes and Johnnie Walker left the station or were dismissed and in January older music typically anything recorded before was dropped from the daytime playlist Many listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC notably Bannister and Trevor Dann s former colleagues at the BBC s London station GLR with Emma Freud and Danny Baker Another problem was that at the time Radio was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the Light Programme and commercial radio which was targeting the Radio and a half audience consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at Radio s expense After the departure of Steve Wright who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January Bannister hired Chris Evans to present the breakfast show in April Evans was a popular presenter but was dismissed in after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week Evans was replaced from February by Mark and Lard Mark Radcliffe and his sidekick Marc Riley who found the slick mass audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them They were replaced by Zoe Ball and Kevin Greening eight months later in October Greening soon moved on leaving Ball as sole presenter The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time with the rise of Britpop in the mid s bands like Oasis Blur and Pulp were popular and credible at the time and the station s popularity rose with them Documentaries like John Peel s Lost in Music which looked at the influence that the use of drugs have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside Broadcasting House At just before on July Radio broadcast on medium wave for the final time In March Radio hosted an Interactive Radio Night with Jo Whiley and Steve Lamacq broadcasting from Cyberia an internet caf and featuring live performances by Orbital via ISDN Later in the s the Britpop boom declined and manufactured chart pop boy bands and acts aimed at sub teenagers came to dominate the charts New genre music occupied the evenings indie on weekdays and dance at weekends with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights The rise of rave culture through the late s and early s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth orientated movement by bringing in club DJ Pete Tong amongst others There had been a dance music programme on Radio since and Pete Tong now the current longest serving DJ at the station was the second DJ to present an all dance music show This quickly gave birth to the Essential Mix where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two hour slot Dance and urban music has been a permanent feature on Radio since with club DJs such as Judge Jules Danny Rampling Trevor Nelson and the Dreem Teem all moving from London s Kiss to the station s Listening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger cross gender age group Eventually this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day Notably the station has received praise for shows such as The Surgery Bobby Friction and Nihal s show The Evening Session and its successor Zane Lowe s show Its website has also been well received However the breakfast show and the UK Top continued to struggle In Zoe Ball was replaced in the mornings by close friend and fellow ladette Sara Cox but despite heavy promotion listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall In Cox was replaced by Chris Moyles The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as The Chris Moyles Show and it increased its audience ahead of the Today programme on Radio as the second most popular breakfast show after The Chris Evans Breakfast Show hosted by Chris Evans Moyles continued to use inappropriate ways to try to tempt listeners from the Wake Up to Wogan show In for example creating a SAY NO TO WOGAN campaign live on air This angered the BBC hierarchy though the row simmered down when it was clear that the campaign had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles The chart show s ratings fell after the departure of long time host Mark Goodier amid falling single sales in the UK Ratings for the show fell in whilst Goodier was still presenting the show meaning that commercial radio s Network Chart overtook it in the ratings for the first time However the BBC denied he was being sacked Before July when the chart release day was changed to Friday the BBC show competed with networked commercial radio s The Big Top Show which was broadcast at the same time Many DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure such as Johnnie Walker Bob Harris and Steve Wright have joined Radio which has now overtaken Radio as the UK s most popular radio station using a style that Radio had until the early s The success of Moyles show has come alongside increased success for the station in general In DJs Scott Mills and Zane Lowe won gold Sony Radio Awards while the station itself came away with the best station award A new evening schedule was introduced in September dividing the week by genre Monday was mainly pop funkrock oriented Tuesday was R B and hip hop Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance with specialist R B and reggae shows Following the death of John Peel in October Annie Nightingale became the longest serving presenter having worked there since s The licence fee funding of Radio alongside Radio is often criticised by the commercial sector In the first quarter of Radio was part of an efficiency review conducted by John Myers His role according to Andrew Harrison the chief executive of RadioCentre was to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings The controller of Radio and sister station Xtra changed to Ben Cooper on October following the departure of Andy Parfitt Ben Cooper answered to the Director of BBC Audio and Music

Sounds The Radio spin off will focus on music from the s and s catering to the appetite from young audiences for recent nostalgia Broadcast Studios From inception for over years Radio broadcast from an adjacent pair of continuity suites originally Con A and Con B in the main control room of Broadcasting House These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges called self op This was a departure from traditional BBC practice where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle Due to needle time restrictions much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators TOs who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts In Radio moved across the road from Broadcasting House to Egton House The station moved to Yalding House in and Egton House was demolished in to make way for an extension to Broadcasting House This extension would eventually be renamed the Egton Wing and then the Peel Wing Until recently the studios were located in the basement of Yalding House near to BBC Broadcasting House on Great Portland Street in central London They used to broadcast from two main studios in the basement Y and Y there is also a smaller studio YP used mainly for production These two main studios Y and Y are separated by the Live Lounge although it is mainly used as an office live sets are rarely recorded from it for Maida Vale Studios is used instead for larger set ups The studios are linked by webcams and windows through the Live Lounge allowing DJs to see each other when changing between shows Y is the studio from where The Chris Moyles Show was broadcast and is also the studio rigged with static cameras for when the station broadcasts on the Live Cam The station moved there in from Egton House In December Radio moved from Yalding House to new studios on the th floor of the new BBC Broadcasting House Portland Place just a few metres away from the Peel Wing formerly the Egton Wing which occupies the land on which Egton House previously stood it was renamed the Peel Wing in in honour of the long serving BBC Radio presenter John Peel who broadcast on the station from its launch in until his death in Programmes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions notably The Mark and Lard Show broadcast every weekday from New Broadcasting House Oxford Road Manchester for over a decade October March the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital In August the studio A from which Radio broadcasts was renamed Mills following the departure of the long running DJ Scott Mills UK analogue frequencies Radio originally broadcast on kHz AM or metres On November the station was moved to kHz and kHz and m The BBC had been allocated three FM frequency ranges in for the then Light Programme now BBC Radio Third Programme now BBC Radio and Home Service now BBC Radio stations Thus when Radio was launched there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station The official reason was that there was no space even though no commercial stations had yet been launched on FM To solve this issue from launch until the end of the s Radio was allocated Radio s FM transmitters for a few hours per week These were Saturday afternoons Sunday teatime and evening most notably for the Top Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons and up until midnight pm to midnight on weeknights including Sounds of the Seventies until and thereafter the John Peel show Mon Thurs The Friday Rock Show with Tommy Vance and most Bank Holiday afternoons when Radio was broadcasting a Bank Holiday edition of Sport on Full time FM broadcasting Due to the rising competition from commercial FM stations the BBC began to draw up plans for Radio to broadcast on FM full time This process began in London on October at low power on a temporary frequency of MHz The Home Office in the UK began to free up FM police communication bandwidths which at the time were operating from MHz to MHz in preparation for new FM radio stations planned for the future which included BBC Radio The BBC acquired FM to FM specifically for Radio The rollout of Radio on FM nationally began on September starting with Central Scotland MHz the Midlands MHz and the north of England MHz On November Belfast was added to the network on another temporary frequency on MHz In January due to the expansion of Radio s FM broadcast hours Radio scaled back its airtime on Radio s FM frequencies ending on weeknights pm midnight Saturday afternoons pm pm and Sunday evenings pm midnight The only programme broadcast on Radio s FM frequency was the UK Top between pm and pm on Sunday At the end of the Top the FM transmitters were handed back to Radio at pm By March with further expansion of Radio FM s frequencies after years all usage of Radio s FM frequencies came to an end especially the UK Top resulting in Radio transmitting on FM full time This was due to the then new BBC Radio broadcasting on Radio s former AM frequencies on MW Radio made great efforts to promote its new FM service renaming itself on air initially as Radio FM and later as FM until After reorganisation and a change of transmitter reallocation of the FM frequencies especially in London from to MHz the Midlands to MHz and Belfast to MHz the engineering programme was completed in End of medium wave broadcasting kHz The Conservative government decided to increase competition on AM and disallowed the simulcasting of services on both AM and FM affecting both BBC and Independent Local Radio Radio s medium wave frequencies were reallocated to Independent National Radio Radio s last broadcast on MW was on July with Stephen Duffy s Kiss Me being the last record played on MW just before am For those who continued to listen just after am Radio jingles were played in reverse chronological order ending with its first jingle from September In the initial months after this closure a pre recorded message by Mark Goodier was played to advise listeners that Radio was now an FM only station and to retune to the FM frequency Around this time Radio began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on Sky Television s via Astra s SES satellite analogue service initially in mono on UK Gold and later in stereo on UK Living transponders The frequencies were allocated to the then newly created Talk Radio UK Digital distribution The BBC launched its national radio stations on DAB digital radio in however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed instead used as a test for future technologies DAB was officially launched in as sets became cheaper Today it can also be heard on UK digital TV services Freeview Virgin Media Sky and the Internet as well as FM In July Sirius Satellite Radio began simulcasting Radio across the United States as channel on its own service and channel on Dish Network satellite TV Sirius Canada began simulcasting Radio when it was launched on December also on channel The Sirius simulcasts were time shifted five hours to allow US and Canadian listeners in the Eastern Time Zone to hear Radio at the same time of day as UK listeners On November Radio made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel moving to XM and Sirius on May Until the full station was removed in August Radio was able to be heard by approximately million listeners in North America on satellite radio alone BBC Radio can be heard on cable in the Netherlands at FM SiriusXM cancellation in North America At midnight on August Sirius XM ceased carrying BBC Radio programming with no prior warning On August the BBC issued the following statement The BBC s commercial arm BBC Worldwide has been in partnership with SIRIUS Satellite Radio to broadcast Radio on their main network since This agreement has now unfortunately come to an end and BBC Worldwide are in current discussions with the satellite radio station to find ways to continue to bring popular music channel BBC Radio to the US audience We will keep you posted Thousands of angry Sirius XM customers began a campaign on Facebook and other social media to reinstate BBC Radio on Sirius XM Radio One week later Sirius and the BBC agreed on a new carriage agreement that saw Radio broadcast on a time shifted format on the Sirius XM Internet Radio platform only on channel Starting on January The Official Chart Show began broadcasting on SiriusXM on channel at pm and pm

moved to the new time slot of midnight to am on Monday mornings and the Scottish and Welsh shows were given new presenters in the form of Ally McCrae and Jen Long The opt outs were only available to

digital version of the station was not regionalised The BBC Trust announced in May that the regional music programmes on Radio would be replaced with a single programme offering a UK wide platform for new music as part of a series of cost cutting measures across the BBC In June the regional shows ended and were replaced by a single BBC Introducing show presented by Jen Long and Ally McCrae Content Music Because of its youth orientated nature Radio plays a broad mix of current and potential future hits including independent alternative hip hop rock dance electronica and pop This made the station stand out from other top stations both in the UK and across the world Since its progressive view on modern electronic music the BBC Radio is well liked and known in the worldwide drum and bass community frequently hosting producers and DJs like Hybrid Minds or Wilkinson Due to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until the needle time limitation the station has recorded many live performances Studio sessions recordings of about four tracks made in a single day also supplemented the live music content many of them finding their way to commercially available LPs and CDs The sessions recorded for John Peel s late night programme are particularly renowned The station has continued to record live music with its Live Lounge feature and the Piano Sessions which started in November The station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs While the station is often criticised for waffling by presenters an experimental more music day in was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it News and current affairs Radio has a public service broadcasting obligation to provide news which it fulfills through Newsbeat bulletins throughout
