unplayable The game used a mix of physical cards with chips embedded with near field communication a specialized electronic game board with NFC and Bluetooth capabilities and a companion application for mobile devices iOS or Android that communicates with the board via Bluetooth By playing a card representing a specific song atop a proper board space the board will detect its NFC code and relay that to the app which will play a sample from that song such as a drum loop or a vocal section With multiple cards on the board the app will manage how all the current songs are mixed as played through the app creating a mashup The game has several game modes for single and multi player play and additional cards featuring more song samples can be purchased as booster packs Gameplay DropMix comes in a core package that includes NFC equipped cards each representing a different song and an electronic game board with five marked spaces the game also requires a mobile device that can

number of cards available Each card is keyed to at least one of four colors the colors representative of the instrument that can be sampled from that song For example yellow represents vocal tracks while blue represents drum tracks The board s five spaces are similarly marked by color with three of the five spaces accepting cards of two different colors Placing a card on a space with a matching color will cause that track sample to be used as part of the app s current mix non matching placement will have no effect In addition each card has a power level marking from one to three In the app
