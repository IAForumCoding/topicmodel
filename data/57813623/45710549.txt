The Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by Nintendo and released worldwide in most regions on March Released in the middle of the eighth generation of home consoles the Switch succeeded the Wii U and competed with Microsoft s Xbox One and Sony s PlayStation it also competes with the ninth generation consoles Microsoft s Xbox Series X S and Sony s PlayStation The Switch is a tablet that can either be docked for home console use or used as a portable device making it a hybrid console Its wireless Joy Con controllers with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input motion sensing and tactile feedback can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld style play They can also connect to a grip accessory to provide a traditional home console gamepad form or be used individually in the hand like the Wii Remote and Nunchuk supporting local multiplayer modes The Switch s software supports online gaming through internet connectivity as well as local wireless ad hoc connectivity with other consoles Switch games and software are available on both physical flash based ROM cartridges and digital distribution via Nintendo eShop the system has no region lockout Two hardware revisions have been released the handheld only Switch Lite released on September and a higher end version featuring an OLED screen released on October The Switch was unveiled on October Known in development by its codename NX the concept came about as Nintendo s reaction to several quarters of financial losses into attributed to poor sales of the Wii U and market competition from mobile games Nintendo s then president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware The Switch s design was aimed at a wide demographic of players through multiple modes of use Nintendo opted to use standard electronic components such as a chipset based on Nvidia s Tegra line to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing game engines As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support leaving it with a weak software library Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third party developers and publishers to help build the Switch s game library alongside its first party games including many independent video game studios While Nintendo initially anticipated around games for its first year over from first party third party and independent developers were released by the end of As of March the Nintendo Switch has shipped over million units worldwide It is Nintendo s best selling home console and the third best selling game console of all time behind the PlayStation and Nintendo DS Switch sales have been strongly tied to sales of Nintendo s first party games with nine having sold over twenty million copies each The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild Mario Kart Deluxe Super Mario Odyssey Super Mario Party Super Smash Bros Ultimate Pok mon Sword and Shield Animal Crossing New Horizons Pok mon Scarlet and Violet and The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo anticipates announcing a successor console to the Switch by March the end of the Japanese fiscal year History Background While Nintendo had record revenues net sales and profits in as a result of the release of the Nintendo DS and Wii in and respectively its revenues soon declined The company posted its first loss as a video game company in prior to the Wii U s introduction that year and had similar losses in the following years due to the console s poor reception The New York Times attributed Nintendo lowering financial forecasts in to weak hardware sales against mobile gaming Previously the company was hesitant about this market with then president Satoru Iwata considering that they would cease to be Nintendo and lose their identity if they attempted to be a part of it About three years prior to the Switch s announcement Iwata Tatsumi Kimishima Genyo Takeda and Shigeru Miyamoto crafted a strategy for revitalizing Nintendo s business model which included approaching the mobile market creating new hardware and maximizing their intellectual property Iwata was able to secure a business alliance with Japanese mobile provider DeNA before his death The deal developed mobile titles based on Nintendo s first party franchises believing this approach would not compromise their integrity Following Iwata s death in July Kimishima was named as president of Nintendo while Miyamoto was promoted to the title of Creative Fellow Development The initial conception for the Switch started shortly after the release of the Wii U in Kimishima stated that when Nintendo was evaluating what new hardware they wanted to produce they didn t just want a successor to either the Nintendo DS or Wii U but instead asked what kind of new experience can we create In an interview with The Asahi Shimbun Kimishima said that the Switch was designed to provide a new way to play that would have a larger impact than the Wii U Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils Aim emphasized the console s appeal as a device that would provide gamers the option to play at home or on the go and noted that it would enable developers to create new types of games This approach continued Nintendo s blue ocean strategy for the competitive console marketplace as rather than compete feature for feature with the other consoles they would establish unique and difficult to copy devices Miyamoto said that some broad concepts of the Switch extend from the lateral thinking with seasoned technology design philosophy of Gunpei Yokoi that Nintendo has used over the last couple of decades The commercial failure of the Wii U also pressured Nintendo in the Switch s development Early sales of the Wii U were weak compared to the Wii and major third party studios like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft announced they would not support the console near the end of the Wii U s first year further hampering its sales According to Fils Aim when it became apparent that the Wii U s life cycle performance would underperform the company s expectations the Switch became a make or break product for Nintendo The design of the Switch was aimed to bridge the polarization of the gaming market at the time creating a device that could play leisurely video games along with games that are aimed to be played deeply according to Shinya Takahashi and Yoshiaki Koizumi general manager and deputy general manager of Nintendo s Entertainment Planning Development Division EPD respectively This approach also would apply to the cultural lifestyle and gaming differences between Japanese and Western players Japanese players tend to play on the go and with social groups while Western players tend to play at home by themselves The design of the Switch would meet both cultures and certain games like Switch could potentially make social gaming more acceptable in Western culture Two key elements that were set to address this mixed market were the ability for the unit to play either on a television screen or as a portable and the use of detachable controllers The Switch name was selected not only to refer to the console s ability to switch from handheld to home console modes but to present the idea of being a switch that will flip and change the way people experience entertainment in their daily lives Part of the inspiration of the Switch s form and design was from feedback players had given Nintendo on the Wii Remote according to Shinya Takahashi With the release of games like Wii Sports and Wii Fit players had asked Nintendo if they could make the Wii Remote in a smaller form factor potentially strapped to a part of their body This led to Nintendo envisioning what a smaller form factor controller could provide in both hardware and gameplay and it led to the idea of a console that was small enough with these new controllers to also be portable Other concepts came out of critical consumer feedback of the Wii U Fils Aim said that one common criticism they had for the Wii U was that while players did enjoy using the Wii U GamePad and would want to play games on it anywhere it became functionless if they moved a distance away from the main console This served for Nintendo to design a home console that the player could take with them anywhere Around five different prototypes were developed for the Switch before they finalized on the released design This included developing different methods of how the Joy Con controllers would physically connect to the console including using magnets to hold them in place In addition to the form factor design Nintendo needed to balance the power and speed of the console s central processing unit with battery life and the unit s size coupled with limited development resources and deadlines set by Nintendo s management One choice made by the development team was to use an existing system on a chip SOC rather than creating their own as they had done on previous consoles Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third party support for the console by using an SOC to which developers could easily port games Nintendo was not focused on raw processing power but was instead looking to balance the overall features of the system including battery life and size as well as keeping in mind their limited development resources and timeline Koizumi said The most difficult part was on how to take an overall balance while we were getting entangled with all of those in complexity To achieve this balance they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used instead using a middle ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch Koizumi served as the general producer of the Switch during its development According to Miyamoto the Switch s development within Nintendo was headed by younger employees with him saying it s really been them that have put this forward and designed this system Miyamoto said of the younger employees I always look for designers who aren t super passionate game fans I make it a point to ensure they re not just a gamer but that they have a lot of different interests and skill sets Junior developers were also used to help brainstorm ideas of how to make sure the Switch had a longer lifecycle beyond the typical five to six years as most other consoles had Miyamoto Takeda and Iwata were less involved but provided necessary oversight on the Switch s development principally around the cost of implementing new features that would make the Switch stand out For Miyamoto his limited involvement allowed him to spend more time on Nintendo s software titles being developed at the time such as Super Mario Run Announcements The first public news of about the Switch s hardware happened alongside the announcement of Nintendo and DeNA s partnership on March At this stage Nintendo referred to the console under the codename NX and described it as a brand new concept At an investor s meeting in April Nintendo announced that it planned to release the NX worldwide in March While Nintendo did not unveil the NX s hardware at E in June it did announce that The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild which was originally announced as a Wii U exclusive would also be released for the NX At a Nintendo shareholders meeting following the conference Miyamoto stated that the company had concerns that competitors could copy ideas from the NX if they revealed it too soon The following month rumors began to surface surrounding the nature of the console including its use of Nvidia Tegra hardware being a hybrid device intended for both home and mobile use controllers that can detach from the main device and be played separately and that Nintendo would distribute games on the console via cartridges and digital downloads On October Nintendo officially announced the console under the name Nintendo Switch alongside a trailer that demonstrated the hardware s nature as a hybrid device At the time of the trailer s release Nintendo did not provide many details on features of the platform though they planned to have events in to provide more details about the console The company stated that there are additional features that were not presented in the introductory trailer Miyamoto and Fils Aim presented the Switch to host Jimmy Fallon on a broadcast of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in December In addition to showing more of the console s hardware and functionality Fallon was given the opportunity to play part of Breath of the Wild live Nintendo revealed technical details of the Switch including its worldwide launch date and price at a press event in Tokyo on January The event was livestreamed with an English voiceover provided by Nintendo of America through their broadcast and regional Twitter accounts relaying details in other languages A Nintendo Treehouse event occurred the following day to reveal the full launch lineup and upcoming games for the Switch Release The Switch was officially released on March worldwide in Japan and most English speaking and Western markets It was released with an MSRP of in Japan US in the United States in the United Kingdom and A in Australia with standardized pricing for the European market varying The set includes a Switch console a dock left and right Joy Con controllers and accompanying straps a Joy Con grip an AC power adapter and an HDMI cable There were two Switch bundles available at launch one with grey Joy Con and one with neon red and blue Joy Con Nintendo feared that a higher price would harm sales which prompted them to not include any additional hardware or games The global launch did not include parts of Asia including India and Mainland China The Switch continued to be officially released in particular markets like Argentina on August and in South Korea and Taiwan on December In April CD Media Nintendo s official distributor in Greece and the Balkans since announced after opening their new offices in Istanbul that Nintendo s products will officially be distributed in Turkey later in the year Nintendo abruptly withdrew from the Turkish market back in June when then distributor Nortec Eurasia closed CD Media released the Nintendo Switch in Turkey in July Nintendo s Singapore based distributor Maxsoft officially launched the Nintendo Switch in the Philippines on November in Thailand on March and in Malaysia on January In early Nintendo of Europe signed a partnership with Tel Aviv based distributor TorGaming Ltd making them Nintendo s official distributor in Israel and launched their products in the market including the Nintendo Switch on March Nintendo s Dubai based distributor Active Gulf officially launched the Nintendo Switch in Oman on September Although the Nintendo Switch had not officially been released in China prior to December it is still widely available in the country due to grey market imports from Hong Kong and other regions such as Japan In January former Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima said in an interview with Chinese news website QQ that Nintendo has tried to release the Switch in China but has been unable to do so Nintendo partnered with Tencent in April to gain the necessary approvals to release the Switch in China along with a test version of New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe it was released on December at a base price of CN or about US Tencent will continue to help Nintendo bring other Switch games through China s approval process via National Radio and Television Administration In addition Tencent will help localize various titles and help implement the Nintendo Switch Online service within the country integrating its offerings with the WeChat payment systems Nintendo had exited the Brazilian market in due to high tariffs but independent resellers have been trading the console in Brazil since March Nintendo had since assigned NC Games as their local game distributor in May and the local company had committed to sell some officially imported Nintendo Switch units in small quantities NC Games silently went defunct in c In August Nintendo affirmed that it would restart imports directly into Brazil for release on September Numerous special edition models and bundles have been released including those for Splatoon the Black Friday shopping day Animal Crossing New Horizons and Fortnite The Japan exclusive nd Unit Set released in May on the My Nintendo Store at a reduced price of was positioned towards households which already owned a Switch It did not include a dock AC adapter HDMI cable and charging grip By February about four years from the console s release Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that The Switch is in the middle of its life cycle The Switch Lite launched on September in three colors yellow grey and turquoise The system was promoted alongside The Legend of Zelda Link s Awakening a remake of the Game Boy game A special Pok mon Sword and Pok mon Shield branded version of the Switch Lite themed around the Pok mon Zacian and Zamazenta launched on November a week before the game s release A coral color was released on March in Japan and on April in the rest of the world A blue color released on May in Europe and on May in the rest of the world A special Pok mon Dialga and Palkia limited edition was released on November days before the release of Pok mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl This special edition pays homage to the Nintendo DS Lite Dialga and Palkia edition Hardware The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid video game console consisting of a console unit a dock and two Joy Con controllers Although it is a hybrid console Nintendo classifies it as a home console that you can take with you on the go In addition the company says that the Switch and the Nintendo DS are meant to co exist considering the DS as an entry level product for younger players Console The main unit of the Switch is the console a battery powered tablet like monitor that consists of an LCD screen measuring inches mm on its diagonal the same as the Wii U GamePad The unit measures by by millimetres in in in and weighs grams oz The screen supports ten point multi touch capacitive sensing and includes haptic technology from Immersion Corporation The LCD screen supports resolutions up to p px The console includes a mm audio jack stereo speakers on the bottom face of the unit below the screen a USB C port for charging and a kickstand on the back side The unit also includes slots for a game card cartridge based media and a microSD card slot located under the kickstand The Switch console itself includes three buttons all on the top of the device Volume and Power The console has rails on the side into which the Joy Con controllers can be slid to attach them to the Switch unit An ambient light sensor on the front of the console adjusts the screen s brightness automatically The model number of the original Switch model is HAC There are three gameplay modes that can be used with the Switch TV mode with the console slid into the dock to support play on a television Tabletop mode with the console placed on a table or other flat surface using its kickstand for shared gaming away from a dedicated screen or in Handheld mode as a standard portable tablet device Users can switch between these modes simply by placing the console in the dock or removing it extending or retracting the kickstand and detaching or connecting the Joy Con Games may be designed to play only in specific modes for example Voez initially could not be played in TV mode and relied on touchscreen controls Support for controllers and TV mode was later added to Voez in January via an update for the game Another example is Super Mario Party which does not support Handheld mode Nintendo stated that the Switch is a single screen experience in that the player either sees the content on the console when it is out of the dock or on the screen attached to the dock when the console is docked The Switch cannot feature dual screen functionality that was offered through the Wii U via its GamePad Nintendo patented a means of using multiple Switch consoles to create a multi monitor configuration by arranging them on a flat surface and spanning a single gameplay environment across their screens This technology was first seen in Super Mario Party Dock The console with or without Joy Con attached can be placed into the Switch dock a docking station with electrical connectors to connect the console to a power supply to charge its battery and to a television via an HDMI connection for video audio output The dock also includes two USB ports and one USB port While docked the unit can support resolutions up to p and a maximum frame rate of frames per second though the maximum resolution varies depending on the game As an example The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild runs at a maximum p and frames per second while the Switch is docked The dock measures by by millimetres in in in and weighs grams oz The dock included with the updated OLED consoles features a slightly redesigned housing as well as replacing the rear USB port with a built in Ethernet port Controllers Joy Con The Nintendo Switch comes with two controllers collectively called Joy Con and individually called the Joy Con L and Joy Con R The controllers attach to the Switch console via side rails using a locking mechanism with a small release button on their rear face to allow them to be detached When detached they can be used as a pair by a single player attached to a grip that emulates a gamepad form factor or used as separate controllers by two individual players A single Switch console can support up to eight Joy Con connections Straps can be attached to the sides of Joy Con when they are detached A charging grip is available for the Joy Con which provides a means to attach a USB C cable for power Alongside that Nintendo released a charging strap that allows players to charge an individual Joy Con via embedded AA batteries on June Pro Controller The Switch also supports a wireless controller called Nintendo Switch Pro Controller which has a more traditional design reminiscent of the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller The Pro Controller connects to the Switch via wireless Bluetooth communication and is charged through a standard USB C port on the controller Other The Nintendo Switch supports a wide array of additional accessories according to Kimishima Kimishima suggested that the Switch is part of a large ecosystem of devices though the Switch unit remains the core console element Takahashi suggested the possibility of other units besides the Joy Con that could attach and or connect to the console to serve as alternate input devices and change how the Switch can be used Nintendo offers a Joy Con Wheel a small steering wheel like unit that a Joy Con can slot into allowing it to be used for racing games such as Mario Kart Deluxe Standalone docks are available which include a power adapter and HDMI cable Third parties also support the Switch with additional accessories such as carrying cases and screen protectors The system update enabled support for GameCube controllers connected via USB with the GameCube adapter that was available for the Wii U as well as a new adapter produced for the Switch GameCube controllers can be used with most games compatible with the Switch s Pro Controller such as Super Smash Bros Ultimate USB computer keyboards are supported for certain tasks such as text entry In January Nintendo announced Nintendo Labo a child oriented platform that combines games coupled with do it yourself cardboard projects that attach or wrap around the Switch Console and Joy Con effectively creating toys around the Switch hardware to interact with games These cardboard units which may also include string rubber bands and other pieces are referred to as Toy Con The game software provides instructions for the Toy Con construction and provides the interface to control the Toy Con Such examples given include a remote controlled car where the two Joy Con attach to the car and their vibration feedback provide the motion for the car controlled from the Switch a fishing rod where the Joy Con are part of the reel and handle of the rod and their motion controls used to simulate the act of fishing in the mini game and a small toy piano In September with the release of Nintendo Switch Online Nintendo introduced NES Controller style Joy Con controllers alongside its classic games service In September when SNES games were added to the service wireless SNES Controllers were released In September when Nintendo games and Sega Genesis titles were added to the service alongside the Expansion Pack wireless Nintendo Controllers and Sega Genesis Control Pads were released for use with their respective services Nintendo released Ring Fit Adventure in October which includes a Leg Strap to mount a Joy Con to a leg and the Ring Con a flexible hard plastic ring with Joy Con mounting The player interacts with the game fashioned after a console role playing game by doing various exercises such as running in place squatting and squeezing the ring to perform in game actions of running jumping and attacking and defending respectively Such features are part of Nintendo s quality of life goals to incorporate physical activity alongside the Switch similar to past titles like Wii Fit In February Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima stated that it had been studying virtual reality solutions but felt that comfort was a main concern Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils Aim also cited that existing VR solutions were not fun or social Nintendo ultimately unveiled a new Labo VR kit in March using a cardboard headset and viewer placed in front of the console s screen in combination with attached accessories Stands and alternate docks have also been created for the Switch to overcome the limitations of the device s own kickstand for tabletop play including an official Adjustable Charging Stand that can be connected to the device s AC adapter Technical specifications SoC CPU GPU and RAM Original Switch models were released with model number HAC The Switch uses a system on chip from the Tegra family of products developed in partnership with Nvidia No specific details were revealed beyond that it is a custom Tegra chip based on the same architecture as the world s top performing GeForce gaming graphics cards that are common in personal computers and has a custom API known as NVN which is designed to bring lightweight fast gaming to the masses Takeda described the Nvidia chipset as being critical for delivering gamers a level of performance similar to that which they experience on personal computers helping to achieve high performance but low power consumption for the Switch Pre release reports unconfirmed by either Nintendo or Nvidia stated that the SoC would be a standard Nvidia Tegra X instead composed of four ARM Cortex A and four ARM Cortex A CPU cores along with Maxwell based CUDA GPU cores This was later corroborated by an analysis on the console done by Tech Insights in March The CPU cores are normally clocked at MHz but the firmware update released in April allows the CPU to clock up to MHz in certain games during loading to improve load times While the SoC features CPU cores the Switch only uses the bit Cortex A cores of which is reserved to the operating system The GPU cores are clocked at MHz when the device is docked and in Handheld mode fluctuating between the following speeds MHz MHz and MHz This gives the Switch s GPU a theoretical peak performance of GFLOPS in TV mode and GFLOPS in Handheld mode A later iFixit teardown of the final product confirmed GB of LPDDR It s clocked at MHz in TV mode while at a reduced MHz in Handheld mode Wireless compatibility The Switch offers Wi Fi dual band ac wireless connectivity compliant with a b g n ac modes Up to eight Switch consoles can be connected in a wireless ad hoc network for local multiplayer games and multiple players can play on each of the connected Switch consoles In the case of at least one game Splatoon ten Switch consoles can connect in the ad hoc network though only eight can play directly while the other two can watch as spectators The Switch uses Bluetooth for wireless communication between the console and its controllers Users can purchase a third party USB LAN adapter for wired connectivity when the console is docked for TV mode Nintendo s Wii LAN adapter accessory is also compatible with the Switch via USB ports on the Switch dock Power battery The Switch is primarily powered in Handheld mode by a non removable mAh V Lithium ion rechargeable battery The battery life is estimated to be between and hours depending on the software being used Nintendo gives the example of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild supporting approximately three hours of battery life The battery can be charged either while in the dock or through a standard USB C connector on the console The estimated recharge time while the unit is in sleep mode is about hours Nintendo offers the means for replacing batteries through its customer support Each Joy Con has its own non removable mAh V Lithium ion battery separate from the console with an estimated twenty hour lifespan These batteries are automatically charged if they are attached to the console while it is charging itself Additional accessories have other means to charge the Joy Con While the basic Joy Con grip that ships with the Switch does not offer charging capabilities a separate premium Joy Con grip includes a USB C connector port that can be used to charge the Joy Con batteries while they are connected to this grip Storage The Switch includes GB of internal storage GB of which is user accessible This can be expanded up to TB using a microSD a microSDHC or a microSDXC card A microSD card slot is located under the Switch s kickstand where a microSD card can be inserted If the microSD card is used the Switch will only store game save data on the internal memory leaving data that can be re acquired on the microSD card Save data will always be stored on the console regardless if the source is a physical game card or a digital download copy At launch there was no way to transfer save files to another Switch console Save game and profile transfers between Switch consoles were added in the system update in October while the system update in April allowed most update data digital games i e downloaded from eShop and other downloaded content to be swapped between the internal memory and a microSD card MicroSD and microSDHC were supported initially and microSDXC card support was later added to the Switch s software via a system update SD cards and miniSD cards do not fit the Switch The Switch did not support external storage units at launch but Nintendo stated that they were looking into adding this feature in the future Connectivity The Switch console has a mm headphone jack At launch the Switch did not support Bluetooth wireless headphones though they can also be connected if a Bluetooth adaptor is connected to the headphone jack A system update in October partially resolved this issue by enabling support for wireless USB headphones when the receiver is connected to the USB port on the console when docked This was later fully resolved in a system update in September when it enabled support for Bluetooth Wireless headphone devices without the need for a USB adapter Later revisions Around July Nintendo quietly released Switch units with minor hardware changes and updated firmware to block exploits in the original Switch models that led to the ability to extract ROM images from game cards and software Nintendo claimed in its case against Team Xecuter and Gary Bowser in February that this hardware change was specifically the result of Team Xecuter s sales of modified Switch chips that used the exploit An updated version of the Nintendo Switch under model number HAC was announced on July and was released in Japan and North America in mid August and in the United Kingdom in September This revision uses the Tegra X SoC a more efficient chipset compared to the Tegra X used in the original model Thus the time on battery was effectively extended to hours depending on the game played No other system component was updated in this revision Production The Nintendo Switch is produced between Taiwan based Foxconn and Japan based Hosiden with Foxconn accounting for the largest volume Nintendo did not plan to sell the Switch below manufacturing cost at launch as they had done for both the DS and Wii U at their respective launches Nintendo affirmed that the Switch would be profitable from launch during its fiscal year earnings report as the company saw the console as a key earnings driver for and beyond Fomalhaut Techno Solutions a Japanese product teardown firm estimated that the Switch cost to make compared to its MSRP with the console and dock at while each Joy Con costs Kimishima said that they may be able to see further profitability on the Switch when they can achieve volume discounts on components once they reach a level of about million Switch units Prior to launch Nintendo anticipated shipping two million Nintendo Switch units by the end of the console s first month and assured that its supply chain would be able to meet demand following the launch period to avoid the shortage situation with the NES Classic Edition in late Kimishima anticipated that the Switch will have lifetime sales numbers similar to the Wii which sold million units by Following the initial sales report numbers in April the Financial Times reported that the company was seeking to produce million Switch units in its financial year as to avoid customer tantrums with poor supply levels particularly near the holiday season and the release of Super Mario Odyssey on October Fils Aim said in September that their production target for the Switch could be hampered by bottlenecks in individual components DigiTimes reported in October that Nintendo had further shifted the production rate for the Switch up to million per month with plans to ship million units by the end of the year the newspaper also stated that the production rate was limited by component availability and not by other factors of Nintendo s production process On the presentation of the fiscal year results to investors Nintendo s newly named president Shuntaro Furukawa stated that they anticipate producing million Switch consoles over the fiscal year keeping the momentum of its sales in that year In June The Wall Street Journal reported that Nintendo was starting to move some of its production of the Switch and two hardware revisions of the Switch outside of China and into Southeast Asia to limit the impact of new United States tariffs on electronics made in China In November Bloomberg reported that Nintendo asked its assembly partners to boost production of the Switch by and raised its target goal of Switch sales for the fiscal year from million units sold to million units having previously reportedly raised their target for the fiscal year from million units sold to million units in August These boosts in production have been attributed to more demand mainly due to the success of Animal Crossing New Horizons during the COVID pandemic Other models Nintendo Switch Lite The Nintendo Switch Lite is a revision of the Switch designed for handheld play released worldwide on September with an MSRP of US First announced in July the Switch Lite is a single unit integrating the Joy Con as part of the main unit s hardware and uses a smaller screen measuring inches cm diagonally Additionally a regular directional pad replaces the four directional buttons on the integrated left Joy Con While using a smaller battery than the original Switch the Switch Lite uses a more power efficient chipset the nanometer Tegra X to extend the estimated use time from to hours to hours on a single battery charge According to The Wall Street Journal Nintendo s goal with the Switch Lite was to produce a sub US unit aimed at casual gamers to compete with gaming services that do not require a dedicated device To achieve this Nintendo negotiated on reduced prices from its component suppliers Further the Journal stated that Nintendo had gained Murata Manufacturing as a battery supplier in addition to TDK to lower costs by causing competition between the two companies The Switch Lite normally only supports games that can be played in handheld mode retaining features like the Switch s gyroscopic sensors Bluetooth Wi Fi and NFC compatibility Some tabletop games that require the HD Rumble or IR camera features such as Switch require players to use separate Joy Con controllers with the Switch Lite The system does not support any docking or connectivity to a television and is thus incompatible with games that require television mode Players who attempt to purchase games that require television or tabletop mode via the eShop on the Switch Lite will be notified of the incompatibility Though not included with the system the Switch Lite does support external controllers otherwise compatible with standard Switch models such as standalone Joy Con controllers though they cannot be docked to the system Some controllers such as GameCube controllers work with the system but require extra adapters as the normal GameCube to Switch adapter uses the USB ports on the full size Switch s dock OLED model On July Nintendo officially announced a new model called the Nintendo Switch OLED Model The OLED model features a inch mm p OLED display and when docked output to p resolution similar to the original model Additionally it features GB of internal storage enhanced audio functions a magnesium alloy body and a wider adjustable stand for use in tabletop mode The unit ships with a new dock that includes a wired LAN port It features similar technical specifications as the base Switch model and is compatible with all Switch games and existing accessories The unit ships in two bundles one that includes a black dock and red and blue Joy Con similar to the base model s default color scheme and one that includes a white dock and white Joy Con It was released on October alongside the release of Metroid Dread with a retail price of Ahead of the release of the OLED version on September Nintendo reduced the base price of the original Switch model in Europe from to and in the UK from to which Nintendo said also reflected changes in currency exchange rates All other regions including North America and Australia did not receive a price cut Four special edition models were released those for Splatoon Pok mon Scarlet and Violet The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom and a Mario Red Edition to tie into Super Mario Bros Wonder Rumored high end model In early reports from The Wall Street Journal and The Nikkei claimed that Nintendo had plans for two new models of the Nintendo Switch One new model was a lightweight revision later revealed as the Nintendo Switch Lite the other was to be a more powerful console to be released in A notification from Nintendo alerting the Federal Communications Commission of changes to the Switch s hardware in July were used as further evidence for a new model DigiTimes later corroborated previous reports claiming Nintendo planned to release a model with an improved CPU and magnesium alloy body in the second half of in December Nintendo denied any intent to release a new model in and the global chip shortage beginning in impacted console production regardless Bloomberg continued to state Nintendo was preparing to release a higher end Nintendo Switch model with an OLED screen and the ability to output a K resolution and the model would release in late However Nintendo announced the Nintendo Switch OLED model in July Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said that Nintendo aims to use technology to enhance gameplay and does not create technology for technology s sake Bloomberg again stated that a higher end Switch was in development and other upgrades were scrapped in favor of only the OLED screen in light of the chip shortage In response Nintendo said that the report was not true and made false claims about the company Zynga one company named by Bloomberg as having received a development kit of an upgraded Nintendo Switch model also denied the factuality of the report Continued rumors of a high end model were fueled by a leak of Nvidia s source code showing a custom chip with DLSS support made for Nintendo In December Digital Foundry claimed that any upgraded Nintendo Switch model was no longer in development and that Nintendo instead is focusing on the system s successor Successor console Industry rumors of a new console emerged in July as several of Nintendo s development partners reported on receiving development kits for this new system Nintendo has alluded to a successor console such as retaining the use of Nintendo Accounts but has avoided affirming any details on a new console Eurogamer among other sources learned from insiders that Nintendo demonstrated features of the new console at Gamescom behind closed doors to developers In mid document discovery in the FTC v Microsoft case revealed that Activision was briefed about the Switch NG NG for next generation in late with its performance stated to be similar to the PlayStation and Xbox One The new console s alleged system on a chip the Nvidia Tegra T codenamed Drake was leaked in the Nvidia ransomware attack by Lapsus and features an octa core ARM Cortex A C CPU a SM Ampere GPU and a bit LPDDR RAM interface Later analysis from public customs manifests suggested it to have GB of LPDDR X RAM and GB of UFS internal storage Sharp Corporation stated they had been providing Nintendo LCD screens for the new console since mid and technology analysis firm Omdia stated these were likely to be inch screens Other reports stated the new console will have DLSS and ray tracing integration and that developers have been shown tech demos running on targeted hardware namely The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild at K resolution and a frame rate of frames per second as well as Epic Games The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine The new console is expected to have backward compatibility with Switch games including those on cartridge and those distributed digitally with some games such as Breath of the Wild supported with enhanced capabilities to take advantage of the new console hardware Early rumors claimed the new system was to be released in late with Nintendo working with its partners to assure high volumes of product at launch Altec Lansing had issued a press release in January that claimed the Switch successor would be out in September which their social media later claimed was just a guess An analyst for Japan based Kantan Games stated in January that the pro model of the Switch should be seen as an iteration of the Switch console rather than a revolution from it and likely would be priced at with new games costing However by February sources had stated Nintendo had told partners that its release was pushed into early with sources speaking to The Nikkei that this was for Nintendo to have sufficient supply and combat scalping On May Nintendo s president Shuntaro Furukawa affirmed that the Switch s successor will be announced during the company s fiscal year which ends on March Software The Nintendo Switch runs on a custom made operating system named Horizon built on a microkernel architecture The Switch s user interface features tile based access to games that are either present in the game card slot or stored within the unit s storage devices It includes quick access buttons for a News feed from Nintendo eShop access and a photo album for screenshots captured during gameplay the update to the software in October also enabled capturing and sharing video from select games A single Switch console supports up to eight user profiles which each can be tied to a Nintendo Account user ID At launch profiles could be represented by either a pre made avatar from an internal gallery or by using a Mii Compared to previous Nintendo consoles the Nintendo Switch s Mii editor allowed for a wider variety of color options for aspects such as hair styles and was implemented into the system settings instead of being an independent application On February Nintendo launched a Missions and Rewards system for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers allowing them to complete missions set by the application like backing up save data or playing Game Trials software to earn Platinum Points which can be spent on various icon parts from different Nintendo games and franchises Icon parts of a specific game like backgrounds borders and characters can then be combined to create an icon Prior to the update players discovered that the Switch s firmware included an Easter egg allowing players to play the NES Golf title via a built in emulator While Nintendo has not confirmed its presence journalists and players believed this to be a tribute to Nintendo s former president Satoru Iwata Golf was programmed by Iwata and the game could only be accessed if the system clock was set to July the day when Iwata died in and the Joy Con are moved similarly to how Iwata would move his hands in his Nintendo Direct presentations Some Japanese users referred to this as an omamori charm left by Iwata himself With the update the executable code for this Easter egg appears to have been wiped by Nintendo In August a Twitter user found files on the Switch s firmware while reverse engineering the console which suggested that Nintendo was possibly testing VR functionality for the Switch The Twitter user was able to activate the hidden VR Mode which split the screen into two displays Hackers found that the code related to possible VR functionality had been hidden in the Switch firmware for over a year Security Nintendo continued its white hat security program that it had with the Nintendo DS With help of third party website HackerOne Nintendo will award up to to the first user to identify any vulnerability that impacts piracy cheating or potential sending of inappropriate content to younger users the amount based on the severity of the security flaw In April two separate groups discovered a method to use an exploit chain in the Tegra chip system that can be used to boot other software on the Switch The exploit could not be patched through a software update as the BootROM of the Tegra X can not be modified after the chip leaves the factory Both groups had notified Nvidia and Nintendo of the exploit before publicly announcing their findings Users studying the hardware determined that Nintendo has the capacity to permanently ban specific Switch consoles used to obtain software via this exploit from the Nintendo Network as the Switch console includes a unique device identification code used as part of the validation to the Network As games downloaded from the Nintendo Network include encrypted information that ties the Nintendo ID to the console which is transmitted to Nintendo when users start playing games Nintendo can track unapproved software downloads and take action Nintendo has reportedly fixed the vulnerability in newer Switch units as of July In June two hackers found a way to run the Switch system s developer software menu on non developer Switch units allowing users to directly load games onto SD cards or create custom avatars for their user profile including pornographic and NSFW pictures which violate Nintendo s terms of service A Nintendo spokesperson responded to Kotaku s article on the topic saying that Modified Nintendo Switch systems have been banned Shortly after the release of Nintendo Switch Online in September hackers and modders were able to figure out how to run unauthorized ROMs on the Nintendo Switch NES emulator A Switch hacker who goes by the name DevRin was the first to discover the hack and posted his findings on YouTube which prompted a modder who goes by the name KapuccinoHeck to investigate the matter with two others and their findings were later posted on KapuccinoHeck s Twitter account Online services Nintendo Switch user profiles can be linked to a Nintendo Account which enables access to online features and the ability to download and purchase software from Nintendo eShop A Nintendo Account can be created with an account from a third party social networking service or an existing Nintendo Network ID from a DS or Wii U Nintendo does not plan to offer first party social networking services on Switch such as Miiverse or StreetPass the latter owing to Nintendo s promotion of Switch as primarily being a home console Instead profiles can be linked to existing social networks such as Facebook and Twitter for social and sharing features Players can register friends through Friend Codes as with previous Nintendo systems searching for friends in the local network through past multiplayer interactions or through Nintendo Account profiles registered as friends on Nintendo mobile apps such as Mario Kart Tour and Super Mario Run In March Nintendo said that they had plans to provide other methods for registering friends including through third party social media and via Nintendo Network IDs Support for registering friends on the Switch via Facebook and Twitter was added on March as part of the system update The Switch has no native support for Nintendo Network IDs but users can link their Nintendo Network ID credentials to a Nintendo Account profile which enables the ability to add friends that they had already registered on their DS or Wii U and share an eShop balance between all three platforms In line with Microsoft and Sony consoles a subscription is required to access online multiplayer in most games The Nintendo Switch Online subscription includes access to online play voice chat access to an ongoing library of Nintendo Entertainment System NES Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES and Game Boy games cloud storage for save data on supported games as well as other special offers and promotions A paid expansion pack released in October added support for an expanding library of Nintendo and Sega Genesis games and in February Nintendo added Game Boy Advance GBA games to the expansion pass The expansion pack also includes access to some paid downloadable content including the Mario Kart Booster Course Pack Splatoon Octo Expansion and Animal Crossing New Horizons Happy Home Paradise Free to play games such as Fortnite Battle Royale and Warframe are exempt from the subscription requirement for online play The Nintendo Switch Online mobile app allows access to voice chat for Switch Online subscribers as well as access to game specific microsites Unlike its competitors voice chat is not supported via the console itself requiring use of the app on a smartphone instead A separate app provides access to parental controls for the console Media support The Switch did not launch with any multimedia oriented features such as a web browser messaging system or support for video streaming services Fils Aim said that because the Switch is geared as a gaming console that is far different from what their competitors offer they had focused on achieving that goal first and foremost and did not see media support as a differentiator from their competitors Niconico a popular Japanese video service launched for the Switch in Japan on July and was the Switch s first third party media app in any market Hulu was the first video streaming application released for the Switch in the United States on November A YouTube application was released on November Fils Aim said in June that conversations to bring Netflix to the Switch were on going though as of Netflix is not available on the Switch On November a trial version app of the Tencent Video streaming service was launched exclusively for Nintendo Switch consoles officially distributed by Tencent in mainland China An official version app will be launched at a later date Funimation launched their own streaming app for the Nintendo Switch featuring a reworked layout and new functions The app became available via eShop in the United States and Canada on December and will launch in various other countries at a later date such as the United Kingdom and Ireland on March A version of the Twitch app launched for the Nintendo Switch on November in most regions worldwide The eShop version of the app allowed users to watch or follow any live or recorded content on Twitch but did not support any native ability for Switch players to contribute content The app was discontinued in January Korg Gadget a music production app was released for the Nintendo Switch on April InkyPen a comics and manga subscription app launched exclusively on the Switch worldwide on December Izneo another comics and manga subscription service was released for the Switch on February FUZE a text based programming language app was released in August Games Distribution Games for the Nintendo Switch can be obtained through either retail channels or digitally through the Nintendo eShop Games distributed at retail are stored on proprietary cartridges similar in design to the game cards used for Nintendo DS games albeit smaller and thinner As the world s first major hybrid console the console is the first major home playable video game system to make use of cartridges since the Nintendo Due to their small size at by by millimetres in in in Nintendo coats each cartridge with denatonium benzoate a non toxic bitterant used to discourage children from ingesting them Nintendo offered a suggested retail price for Switch games at the console s launch of US equivalent to the price for new games on either the Xbox One and PlayStation Nintendo otherwise allows publishers to set the price for a game only requiring the list price be the same for physical and digital releases if a physical release is made This has caused some games also available on other consoles to be priced higher on the Switch due to the costs of manufacturing the game card for the Switch version Online media outlets have colloquially referred to this price hike as the Switch tax The Switch tax also applies to many games that had been previously released on other platforms ported later to the Switch where the Switch game price reflects the original price of the game when it was first released rather than its current price As of August it is estimated that the cost of Switch games is an average of over other formats Game cards at the time of the Switch s release had a GB capacity Nintendo had planned to introduce GB game cards by the second half of but had to push this back Some physical games may still require content to be installed to internal storage with some games using a significant portion of the internal memory if a microSD card is not available Other physical games which have a large amount of content may require a microSD card to be present in the Switch such as NBA K such games are clearly marked on the cover to show these requirements The Switch supports the ability for cloud gaming to run games that require more hardware capabilities than the Switch allows running these games over a network with the game computations performed on server hardware These games may be tied to specific regions due to purchasing options Early examples of such games on the Switch include Resident Evil Biohazard Phantasy Star Online and Assassin s Creed Odyssey which were primarily limited to Japanese releases while more recently Control and Hitman will be offered through cloud gaming worldwide in and beyond Unlike previous Nintendo home consoles the Switch is region free This allows players to use cartridges or downloaded content from any part of the world with the exception of Chinese game content which can only be played on Switch units manufactured for that country Nintendo recommends using the appropriate regional eShop for digital purposes for obtaining the best post purchase support if needed Nintendo opted to go region free to reduce the amount of workload and cost to both themselves and developers in having to manage two or more regional certification processes and different ROM cartridge production pathways for those regions Further eShop purchases while still tied to the Nintendo Account are not tied to the specific Switch console as was the case for previous Nintendo hardware Once the user re registers their account to a Switch they have access to download all previous purchases however a user can only have their account registered on one console at a time and downloaded software tied to an account cannot be used if that account is not registered to the device With the console s system update alongside the launch of the Online service in September a user can play games that they have purchased from the eShop on a second Switch console though requiring continuous online connection and other restrictions The Switch does not use optical discs and as such does not have native backward compatibility with software from any previous Nintendo console The Switch is also not backward compatible with other digital titles from previous consoles Emulated versions of games from previous Nintendo systems are offered through eShop and the Nintendo Switch Online service although the blanket Virtual Console brand used for these releases on Wii Wii U and DS has been dropped In February Kimishima said that the Switch is powerful enough to emulate titles from previous Nintendo consoles Third party support One of the generally perceived failures of the Wii U was a lack of support from third party developers leading to a weak library of games Nintendo was more aggressive in trying to bring on third party developers early in the Switch s development to ensure a stronger lineup of games Takahashi and Koizumi reached out to many of the third parties directly to help gain their support early on Electronic Arts executive Patrick S derlund said that Nintendo had taken a different track with attracting third party developers to the Switch and have engaged Electronic Arts and other major developers throughout the development of the Switch listening to their input to help make the Switch more successful Nintendo also began gaining support of independent video game developers in the middle of to provide assistance to help them bring games to the Switch led by Nintendo s head of partner management Damon Baker They had tried to draw in indie developers near the end of the Wii U s lifetime providing indie game demos that were highlighted during E but by this point the Wii U had already been considered a failure Nintendo sees games such as Snipperclips as a model of their target for indie games in which they worked to help provide Switch implementation support and software tools to these parties early in the console s lifecycle according to Takahashi and Koizumi Some like Yacht Club Games who have ported Shovel Knight to the Switch noted that some of the major innovations in the Switch such as the Joy Con were not revealed to them until just prior to the January announcement Nintendo of America reached out to many independent developers and publishers including Chucklefish Team and Devolver Digital to gain titles for the platform and make the process of publishing easier Nintendo still curates which titles they allow on the system using the company s past portfolio for evaluation and still carefully time releases to keep a steady stream of new content However once a game is greenlit pushing out patches and updates can be done rapidly and at no further cost to the developer Nintendo also offers the Switch s dev kit at yen or about far under the cost of a comparable dev kit for other consoles making it more amenable for smaller developers to afford and build for the unit Nintendo offers several of these indie games as Nindies through the eShop Nintendo had anticipated that they would have at least sixty indie games released for the Switch through but ended up with over titles by the end of as a result of the console s popularity Indie developers have found that Nintendo has also had a significant role in the promotion and marketing of their games including using the games to help promote the Switch itself in contrast to Microsoft or Sony These developers also found Nintendo tries to keep a better rapport with fans of Nintendo s products and help these fans identify Switch indie games they feel they will like the most including those games that build on Nintendo s classic games from the NES SNES and Game Boy eras that can draw in a more global audience Baker says that while they do try to encourage indie developers to release their games as a Switch console exclusive they do not force developers towards this knowing that the developers must have a good business case for doing so While many independent developers have praised Nintendo for better support for the Switch others speaking anonymously through Nintendo Life noted that Nintendo seemed to have a walled garden approach with independent developers a remnant from the WiiWare program that allowed a great deal of shovelware to be pushed onto it These anonymous developers found that Nintendo was either eschewing some developers completely or requiring them to have a well known publishing partner or an inside person within Nintendo to be able to gain the rights to publish for the Switch Baker said that they encourage self publishing but do also place value on trust of established partners for their recommendations of what games would be best for the Switch Another factor limiting Nintendo is the availability of dev kits and other hardware at the start of the console s life However Baker does anticipate that Nintendo will be much more open in the future once they have addressed the necessary issues for curation and discovery of titles via the eShop During its official unveiling in October Nintendo deliberately opted not to provide a list of games for the system as they want people to touch the device in January and experience the software for themselves according to Kimishima Instead Nintendo announced some of the partners that had committed to supporting the Switch contrasting Nintendo s struggles to gain third party support on launch for previous platforms the company initially listed third party publishers studios and middleware developers Among these partners Nintendo listed major publishers such as Activision Bethesda Electronic Arts Sega Square Enix Take Two and Ubisoft Nintendo had previously relied more on providing its own internally developed tools and libraries that third party developers would use to develop games for earlier systems With the Switch the company went a different route According to Takahashi we have been aiming to realize an environment in which a variety of different third party developers are able to easily develop compatible software taking advantage of the Nvidia chipset s support for many standard libraries that allows for ease of transition from other platforms to the Switch Unity Technologies Epic Games and the Khronos Group pledged support to help developers bring games to the Switch using their game engines and middleware Unity Unreal Engine and the Vulkan and OpenGL graphical APIs respectively for instance the Unreal Engine toolkit was updated in February to provide beta testing for native support for Switch games with full support added by May In March Nintendo announced it had also gained support of YoYo Games GameMaker Studio engine for the Switch Miyamoto said that Nintendo s own developers have mastered engines like Unreal so that while it would be unlikely that Nintendo would release a first party title using such software they can help support developers using these tools on the Switch Several indie developers who have previously worked on Nintendo s consoles said that the Switch was the least demanding Nintendo console they have developed In addition to these third party middleware solutions Nintendo developed its own NintendoWare Bezel Engine for first and third party developers first announced in aimed to provide an environment that can create interesting games in a short period of time while keeping development costs as low as possible Games like Tetris and Clubhouse Games Worldwide Classics were developed in this engine By the Switch was generally considered to have reversed the trend of flagging third party support for Nintendo consoles and game platforms something that was attributed to Nintendo having made concerted outreach efforts towards third parties to bring them on board Positive analyses of the Switch s impact on Nintendo s third party relations were however frequently laced with the caveat that Nintendo would have to work to transition their third party support from the Switch to the Switch s successor properly something they had routinely failed at in the past Library The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild originally announced as a Wii U exclusive was released for the Switch as a launch title The console s reveal trailer showcased footage from new titles in Nintendo franchises including Super Mario Odyssey Mario Kart Deluxe and Splatoon as well as footage from NBA K and The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Although Nintendo and third parties stated at that time that these were not necessarily representative of Switch titles all five titles were confirmed as Switch releases during the January press events The Switch did not launch with any bundled games or have any pre loaded games or game demos Fils Aim stated that once they had decided on the price point and evaluated the forthcoming game lineup they opted to allow consumers to choose which games to get rather than include one in the bundle and increase its price At least ten games were shipped or digitally available alongside the Switch in time for its North American launch including Nintendo s first party titles The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and Switch Fils Aim said that Nintendo planned a steady cadence of content for the Switch after launch avoiding the perceived situation with gaps between major releases for Wii U software Kimishima said that Nintendo scheduled its first party releases to continue to provide new titles regularly without long gaps as this encourages consumers to continue actively playing the system maintains buzz and spurs continued sales momentum for Nintendo Switch Journalists noted that Nintendo appeared to be pledged to this approach following their schedule of planned releases of first party games for the Switch as announced during E with a new title roughly every month into early was a record breaking year for the Nintendo Switch with games released Marketing A key part of marketing the Switch was to be crystal clear in our communication of what the product was and what the product could do according to Fils Aim so as to avoid similar issues with how they presented the Wii U While the Wii U was designed as a home console unit Nintendo s lack of clarity on this point led to a general assumption that the unit principally the Wii U GamePad was more like a tablet overshadowing the Wii U s other features such as dual screen play modes Nintendo also believed that some consumers had mistaken the Wii U GamePad as being an accessory for the existing Wii console rather than being the flagship feature of an entirely new platform Instead for the Switch Fils Aim said the company was very aggressive and clearly communicating the proposition that it s a home console you can take on the go wherever and whenever you want For example the October trailer considered significantly unlike Nintendo s past marketing efforts according to Bloomberg was designed to show the various ways that the Switch can be used so that viewers would recognize that each of its forms offer different play experiences for people to enjoy Kimishima said that the intent of the trailer was to show that the device was aimed across all player demographics showcasing features that core gamers would recognize and appreciate to carry this intent A large amount of Nintendo s launch marketing for the console focused heavily on the launch title Breath of the Wild Nintendo of America marketing executive Nick Chavez stated that the decision to showcase the new Zelda game was meant to promote it to both older viewers who may have grown up with the franchise s earliest games and are accustomed to modern open world games and to a new generation of players Nintendo aired its first ever Super Bowl ad during the United States broadcast of Super Bowl LI Set to the Imagine Dragons song Believer the ad showcased the various play modes with the Switch and its launch titles particularly Breath of the Wild and upcoming releases while an ad to celebrate the th anniversary of Pok mon was broadcast the previous year during Super Bowl this ad was paid for by The Pok mon Company and not by Nintendo Chavez said of the ad There s no bigger stage in the U S on which to showcase the platform I think it speaks to our confidence in the system Additional television commercials followed the Super Bowl spot which were to demonstrate Switch s use cases among different demographics as well as casual and core gaming audiences Such ad venues included the NCAA Division I men s basketball tournament the Kids Choice Awards and on programming blocks for Nickelodeon Adult Swim and Comedy Central Chavez emphasized that Nintendo s overall marketing for Switch was not be just a six to eight week launch campaign but really a month campaign for us to say nothing of our plans for In addition to advertising Nintendo had planned several ways for players to try the system before its release through various sampling events Kimishima felt that it was important particularly for career gamers for Nintendo to get the Switch into players hands so that players could understand how the system differs from Nintendo s previous offerings Kimishima also said that the company was running a guerrilla marketing program where we re just dashing around and trying to have as many events as possible and get it in the hands of players so they can experience the difference The North American and European press had special events on January following the Tokyo presentation Various Switch demonstration events were run in North America Europe and Japan during January and February Nintendo offered demonstrations of the Switch at gaming conferences including PAX South South by Southwest and RTX Nintendo also promoted the Switch through an Unexpected Places campaign in February temporarily setting up living room style spaces in three United States locations and inviting fans and players including John Cena to try out the unit In June Nintendo announced it was partnering with Disney Channel to help produce Nintendo Switch Family Showdown a televised competition where families competed in challenges around various Switch games in August Reception Pre release Market analysts had a mixed response to the October announcement of the Nintendo Switch Some expressed concern that the Switch failed to address the issues that led to poor Wii U sales and was aimed at a small audience Others were more upbeat believing the Switch approach would fit in well in the Japanese market where space for dedicated consoles and televisions are limited and transition into Western ones Taylor also approved of the company s decision to introduce the console prior to the holiday season when Microsoft and Sony would attempt to attract casual gamers to their consoles Following the January press conference revealing the unit s pricing and release date journalists expressed concern at the apparently high system price comparable to the PlayStation and Xbox One consoles but lacking some of their capabilities the cost of the paid for Nintendo Switch Online service and the small number of games that were confirmed for launch However other analysts found that the pricing factors indicated the Switch was a more robust console and would likely sell better than the Wii U with The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild being a key sales driver These analysts also figured the Switch fills an appropriate gap in hardware for those seeking more complex gameplay that is not offered in tablet and mobile gaming but who did not need to purchase a powerful boxy console Most analysts agreed that the success of the Switch depends on Nintendo s support and avoiding mistakes the company had made in marketing and promoting the Wii U Nintendo investors showed wariness at the Switch as its stock price dropped in the months from the system s announcement up until its release Analysts believed investors felt the Switch was very risky and were unsure if the unit would draw new audiences to Nintendo Analysis firms estimated the Switch would have a slow start due to the risk of the system and high price but could still clear up to million units by Game and hardware developers were more positive towards the Switch seeing the system as a more unifying experience between their handheld and console divisions but expressed concern on unanswered hardware specifications and how Nintendo would market the unit to draw in developers Developer Hideo Kojima compared the notion of the Switch to his idea of transfarring that he presented in allowing players to take a game from a home platform to a portable one which became the basis of Sony s cross buy program He said that the Switch was an extension of that idea The fact you can play something at home and take it outside this is the gamer s dream The Switch is an evolution of that Bethesda s Todd Howard stated I think Nintendo is the only company that could pull something like this off commenting on the Nintendo Switch s design and functionality Phil Spencer head of Microsoft s Xbox division said he was impressed with Nintendo s ability to state a bold vision and build a product that delivers on that vision Retailers were also generally positive with the Switch GameStop CEO Paul Reines stated the unit was transformative in the market and would be a game changer that could expand the audience for gaming Pre orders were high with Kimishima stating before launch that total pre orders reached nearly the levels of units they had ready to ship for launch The October reveal trailer became Nintendo of America s most viewed video on YouTube within hours and was the top trending video on YouTube for about a day Release Upon release the Switch was praised by reviewers for having a lot of potential but they were underwhelmed by the limited number of titles available at launch that did not show the full extent of the console s abilities Reviewers also noted that the initial operating software and features were limited and included software bugs that while likely to be fixed in time marred the experience of the system Even with the day one update there were numerous reports of hardware problems in particular the Bluetooth connectivity of the Switch console with the Joy Con L controller and ease with which the console screen could be scratched About a week after release Fils Aim said the company is in fact finding mode to try to diagnose these issues In late March Nintendo reported that the Joy Con L desync issue was a manufacturing variation on a small number of the units which could be easily fixed as noted by CNET s Sean Hollister Nintendo repaired affected controllers by placing a bit of conductive foam near the antenna within the unit to better shield it Going forward Nintendo said they do not anticipate any other problems with connectivity issues Many users also reported issues with defective pixels on the LCD screen of the console which Nintendo has stated are normal and should not be considered a defect Other companies in the video game industry such as Sony Microsoft Sega Bethesda Ubisoft and Unity Technologies congratulated Nintendo on the Switch along with fast food companies such as Arby s and Domino s Pizza which made a practice of posting game inspired artworks on social media About six months after release Nintendo reported their usage statistics for the Switch Using statistics collected by the system for the primary player on the console they found that of users operate the console in Handheld Tabletop mode more than of the time slightly more than of users operate the console in both TV mode and Handheld Tabletop mode equally with the remaining users preferring TV mode Nintendo stated We can clearly see that consumers are playing to suit their own play styles Nintendo also found that the majority of people who purchased the Switch in the United States are male consumers in their s and early s Following the implementation of firmware version several Switch users began reporting that their consoles became unusable after having been docked within a third party portable dock manufactured by Nyko Nyko commented on the issue stating that they were aware of the issue and thought it to be caused by the Switch s handling of A V output while Nintendo advised users against docking their systems inside unlicensed docking peripherals After purchasing the dock at a Walmart store in Jacksonville Florida and losing usability of his console upon using the dock Switch owner Michael Skiathitis filed a class action lawsuit against Nyko alleging the dock to be prone to causing numerous problems to the devices they are intended to support against the knowledge of purchasers as well as noting that Nyko had not put much effort into warning consumers about the issue Other Switch owners reported having their consoles bricked upon using various other third party docks including models made by FastSnail and Insignia The Verge rated the Nintendo Switch Lite out of points praising its improved battery life over the standard Nintendo Switch as well as the design and the D pad but criticizing the lack of a TV mode and the fact that some games are not compatible with the base model alone PC Magazine criticized the components used in the Switch Lite for their quality because just like the Joy Con of the original Nintendo Switch the analog sticks of the console are also susceptible to drifting Sales Initial launch Initial sales of the Switch were strong with Nintendo reporting that based on its first week s numbers it was the company s fastest selling console In Japan first weekend sales exceeded units which was on par with the PlayStation during its launch period Sales during this initial period were strong in the United States United Kingdom France and Germany Media Create estimated that more than Switch units were sold in Japan within its first month beating out the PlayStation to this figure Nintendo issued the Switch s first month s performance in their fiscal year results which ended March reporting that more than million units had been sold worldwide exceeding their target of two million Retailer GameStop reported that initial sales of the Switch were phenomenal and on track to surpass the Wii U based on their historical sales data with merchandising director Eric Bright saying the Switch has had one of the highest attach rates of software and accessories to a device that we ve seen in a long time Retailer GameStop reported significant growth in hardware sales in its first quarter of due primarily to the Switch while Best Buy saw an unexpected increase in their hardware sales in its first quarter of buoyed by the popularity of the Switch Console sales in Japan which had been languishing due to the strength of the mobile game market saw its first annual growth of in due to the release of the Switch Physical sales for Switch games were at million worldwide in its first month with million copies of Breath of the Wild for the Switch making up nearly half of those sales On Breath of the Wild s nearly to sales with the Switch console Nintendo s Kimishima said This high of an attach rate is more or less unprecedented The large sales within the first month forced Nintendo to increase their production capacity and to temporarily use air freight to ship Switch units instead of their usual overseas shipment costing an estimated per console rather than the less costly overseas shipment With these changes Nintendo projected that it would sell at least million Switch consoles during the fiscal year alongside million games Kimishima stated that having a Switch user base of million will give publishers and the rest of our business partners a sense that the future of Nintendo Switch is more promising and spur further game development for the platform Kimishima said that a key goal in their production ramp up would be to make sure they have enough Switch inventory near the end of for holiday sales as to avoid the issue with Wii shortages that occurred during its first holiday season period while balancing the near term high demand According to Kimishima Nintendo now believed that if they could reach million in Switch sales in they expected the Switch would have lifetime sales comparable to the Wii which had sold over million units in its lifetime The Switch continued to show strong sales throughout its first year of release In its financial report released in October for the quarter ending September Nintendo reported worldwide sales of the Switch at million with the expectation to sell more than million by the end of its current financial year exceeding the Wii U s lifetime million sales Five software titles had achieved at least one million in sales by this point Breath of the Wild M Mario Kart Deluxe M Splatoon M Switch M and Arms M Shortly after this financial report Nintendo reported that Super Mario Odyssey for the Switch sold more than two million copies within three days of its release on October Following this financial report the Wall Street Journal asserted that Nintendo anticipated to continue ramping production of the Switch in its fiscal year with plans to produce between and million units that year or more depending on the holiday sales During the November Black Friday Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday sales that kicked off the holiday shopping season in North America Adobe Digital Insights analysis showed the Switch was one of the top five selling items outpacing the PlayStation or Xbox One NPD Group adjusted their future performance of the Switch to follow more closely with the Wii s lifetime sales rather than the Wii U s On December the company announced the system had sold over million units worldwide having reached its sales goal for the fiscal year within nine months Nintendo raised its Switch sales expectation to million units for the fiscal year Shortly after this announcement Kimishima said that Nintendo has a target of million units sold within the console s second year along with releasing new games that enables new ways of playing to continue the sales momentum Based on its first year sales the Switch was considered to be the fastest selling game console in history in many regions With year end Japanese sales data from Media Create the Switch became the fastest selling home console in Japan in first year sales with its total sales of million units exceeding the million units of the PlayStation during its first year of release while Famitsu reported that these sales had eclipsed the lifetime sales of the Wii U in the country and helped to support the first growth in sales within Japan s console market in eleven years Nintendo of America also reported that with million units sold in the United States by the end of million units in December alone the Switch was the fastest selling console in the United States in its first months outpacing the Wii s performance of million units in the same time period Similarly the Switch was the fastest selling console in France having sold units through the end of according to Nintendo France The Switch was also the fastest selling console in Canada having shipped units in its first months narrowly outpacing the Wii s performance of units in the same time period according to TechVibes According to analysis firm GBH Insights the Nintendo Switch was the fifth best selling technology product in As of January the Switch has sold more than units in Spain surpassing the total lifetime sales of one of its competitors the Xbox One in the region The Switch sold million units in the United States in its first months of availability surpassing the sales of Xbox One and PlayStation during their first months in the same region By May the Switch had overtaken the PS s lifetime sales in Japan Lifetime units shipped As of March Nintendo has shipped million Switch units with over million original Switch units million Switch Lite units and million Switch OLED units It is currently Nintendo s best selling home video game console of all time The Switch has surpassed lifetime sales of all but one Nintendo game console following the Nintendo DS By this point it also surpassed sales of all other game consoles leaving it third behind the DS and the PlayStation Since October the Switch had been the highest selling console in the United States for consecutive months starting from December taking the record from the Xbox which stood for months August April In the United States the Switch had remained the best selling console on monthly sales based on NPD Group data for months from November through August with the PlayStation breaking its streak in September Nintendo s president Shuntaro Furukawa said in the company s Q fiscal earnings report ending December that about of the sales of the Switch Lite were from existing owners of the full size Switch console making the Lite a backup console for them Furukawa also said that for those purchasing their first Switch console there was a higher percentage of female consumers that purchased the Lite compared to the full size Switch console and that Nintendo would increase production of the Lite for that market Software sales As of December total software sales for the Switch exceeded billion According to Nintendo of America s Doug Bowser the Switch has had an attach rate games purchased per unit of over over its first four years Top sellers for the platform as of March include Mario Kart Deluxe million Animal Crossing New Horizons million Super Smash Bros Ultimate million The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild million Super Mario Odyssey million Pok mon Sword and Shield million Pok mon Scarlet and Violet million Super Mario Party million The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom million New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe million Financial impact Nintendo s business performance which had been struggling for several years soared upon the release of the Switch By May the success of the Switch s launch raised Nintendo s stock price to its highest levels in seven years and an increase in price of over from the previous year However the price still trailed Nintendo s peak price by about half back in when it had just released the Wii Nintendo s stock was further boosted a few days later to meet its eight year high following Capcom s announcement of plans to release the popular Monster Hunter XX for the Switch In September Nintendo announced a partnership with Tencent the leading publisher for mobile games in China to bring their title Arena of Valor the international version of their mainland Chinese game Wangzhe Rongyao to the Switch following its December release in Western markets on mobile platforms At the time the game had an estimated million players most in China and analysts anticipated that Nintendo would be releasing the Switch in China by as part of this deal As a result Nintendo s stock price rose overnight on the news by reaching a nine year high Nintendo s stock reached its ten year high shortly after the October expansion of Switch production to million units per month and speculation that Nintendo would likely start selling the unit in China sooner than anticipated Nintendo s quarterly reports for the period ending September showed a profit of million the first profitable quarter in several years due to both success of
