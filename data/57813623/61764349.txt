groups performed musical numbers Ratings and reception Nominees USgamer s Eric Van Allen criticized the Game of the Year nominees for favoring The Outer Worlds over games like Disco Elysium Fire Emblem Three Houses and Outer Wilds he similarly expressed his surprise that Death Stranding received so many nominations He appreciated the indie game nominations in most categories but felt they were unfairly ignored for Game of the Year Game Rant s Dalton Cooper named Astral Chain Devil May Cry and Fire Emblem Three Houses the biggest snubs Inverse s Jen Glennon felt Fire Emblem Three Houses was snubbed in categories like Best Art Direction and Best Audio Design and considered its Best Strategy Game nomination inappropriate as it is a role playing game PC Gamer s Andy Chalk expressed his confusion of Fresh Indie Game nominees as several had created prior games despite the category s intention for first time developers Death Stranding s record ten nominations prompted allegations of impropriety and a conflict of interest due to Keighley s friendly relationship with game director Hideo Kojima and his cameo appearance in the game Keighley said he understood and appreciated the concern but reiterated he does not partake in the jury nominations or award selections noting he intentionally distances himself due to his close working relationship with developers and publishers Additionally while Kojima sits on the advisory board for the Game Awards Keighley asserted the board had no direct influence on the selections Kotaku s Heather Alexandra wrote that the close relationship would continue to reflect poorly on the ceremony regardless of Keighley s clarification Ceremony The show received a mixed reception from media publications CNET s Jackson Ryan found the show felt like one giant advert but praised some of the announcements including the Xbox Series X Hellblade II and Weird West as well as the performance by Chvrches IGN s Matt T M Kim similarly praised some of the surprise reveals but felt the show focused more heavily on trailers than awards Pocket Gamer s Matthew Forde wrote mobile games have no place at The Game Awards both for announcements and awards due to incompatible audiences he felt a separate presentation like Nintendo Direct would be more appropriate PC Gamer s Chalk found the show lacked mega blockbuster game reveals like The Elder Scrolls or Mass Effect Vice s Patrick Klepek praised Disco Elysium s awards success and TheGamer s Patricio Kobek suspected it would shape future games and hoped it would lead to more experimental developers Viewership The Game Awards was the most viewed ceremony to date a feat that surprised Keighley as he suspected the show had hit its peak in Over million streams were used to view the show an increase of percent from the ceremony s million At its peak the show had over million concurrent viewers including over million across Twitch and YouTube The show had increased viewership in China which Keighley partly attributed to the League of Legends announcements The increased viewership reassured Keighley that a digital show was more effective than a television broadcast He partly attributed the viewership increase to a general rise in live streaming but felt it was difficult to cite a specific factor Notes References External links Official
