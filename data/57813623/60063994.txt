Development The ideas for the cloud service came within Microsoft around around the same time that Kareem Choudhry developed the Xbox backwards compatibility for the Xbox One As his team developed this solution Choudhry also had the idea if they could provide these games without having need of a console and got Spencer s go ahead to start a small team to determine the feasibility of cloud gaming The technology was deemed successful enough at around the time of Xbox Game Pass s introduction that Microsoft assembled a larger team to build up the cloud gaming platform Microsoft teased the service at E and formally announced Project xCloud several months later in October They demonstrated the service in March with the racing game Forza Horizon playing on an Android smartphone with an Xbox One controller Xbox head Phil Spencer used a private server during this time to test games on a remote connection The service entered its home testing phase in May when it could be used outside the lab environment It entered public testing later in the year and was unveiled at E Microsoft said that its Xbox content library will make its service more appealing than competitors such as Stadia The hardware at launch used Xbox One S based blade servers but began to transition to Xbox Series X based servers in June Each server initially had four customized Xbox One S based units for the teaser but this was doubled to eight per server in a U enclosure for the service s launch in Compared to the standard Xbox One S power consumption has been reduced by through processor specific power

tablet that has at least Android and Bluetooth Examples of supported devices include the Samsung Galaxy Tab S e the OnePlus and the Galaxy S Ultra In March Microsoft released an update to the Android Xbox Cloud Gaming client that allows dual screened devices like the Surface Duo to use the second screen to host the touch controls Several notable games such as Minecraft Dungeons and New Super Lucky s Tale support the dedicated gamepad on the second screen Some games such as Gears support motion controls using the device s built in gyro and provide a dedicated control scheme when using the gamepad mode In October Meta Platforms announced an Xbox Cloud Gaming app for Meta Quest based on Android source code virtual reality headsets iOS While Microsoft had planned to release xCloud for iOS devices the company halted iOS testing in August asserting that policies on the Apple App Store limited what functionality they could provide for the service Apple clarified that cloud streaming services like xCloud allow Microsoft to release games onto the iOS platform that bypass the normal checks that Apple performs for other apps and thus refused to allow the app on the platform However in September Apple altered its rules that allowed xCloud and other cloud gaming apps to work on iOS with restrictions that each game must be offered as an individual download on the iOS store which the user must use before playing though catalog apps as part of the service can list and link to these games Microsoft responded negatively to this change stating that This remains a bad experience for customers Gamers want to jump directly into a game from their curated catalog within one app just like they do with movies or songs and not be forced to download over apps to play individual games from the cloud We re committed to putting gamers at the center of everything we do and providing a great experience is core to that mission Microsoft had considered the possibility of making each game its own application as to satisfy Apple s requirements according to The Verge based on emails uncovered during the Epic Games v Apple trial Microsoft suggested in October that to work around Apple s restriction it may bring xCloud to iOS as a browser based web application which would not have its content restricted by the App Store limitations The company later announced that it will use this approach to bring a browser based version of the cloud gaming service to both personal computers and to iOS devices to be released sometime by the second quarter of An invite only beta test of the browser version started on April The full version for all Xbox Game Pass subscribers was released on June Xbox consoles Microsoft also announced plans to bring cloud gaming to the Xbox One and Xbox Series X S consoles later in which would also allow Xbox One users to play games that are only able to run on the Series X S consoles The feature was made available on November Other devices Alongside the iOS browser based version browser based Xbox Cloud Gaming through supported browsers in Windows computers was added for Xbox Game Pass subscribers on June Invite only beta testing launched alongside the iOS beta test on April Spencer has also stated that Microsoft is working to bring the service to smart TVs and streaming sticks though a challenge here is assuring minimal latency between the television and the controller Microsoft confirmed in May that a streaming device was in development under the codename Keystone However by November Spencer stated that they had ceased development of this device as it was too costly compared to the Xbox Series S and surpassed the price range they had envisioned In July Xbox Cloud Gaming was launched on select Samsung Smart TVs and Smart Monitors via the Xbox app with support for Bluetooth controllers Microsoft said that other smart TV brands were being evaluated for the Xbox app for smart TVs See also Azure Virtual Desktop EA
