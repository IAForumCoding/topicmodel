other nations fall into financial turmoil Sera s citizens balkanize into two warring factions the Coalition of Ordered Governments COG and Union of Independent Republics UIR The ensuing year strife known as the Pendulum Wars consumes millions of lives with both sides locked in a virtual stalemate The UIR develops the Hammer of Dawn a system of satellites capable of delivering precise and

the Hammer of Dawn The UIR surrenders after witnessing the Hammer of Dawn completed by Marcus Fenix s father Professor Adam Fenix devastate one of their naval vessels Six weeks after the COG and UIR agreed to an armistice a race of subterranean creatures known as the Locust Horde emerge from Sera s depths and begin assaulting human cities wiping out of the world population in the first hours referred to as Emergence Day The Locust overwhelm the already battle worn COG forces during this surprise attack causing them to retreat to the Jacinto Plateau where the Locust cannot dig through its granite bedrock and reluctantly bombard their own cities with the Hammer of Dawn to halt the Locust s advance The ensuing scorched earth tactic destroys much of Sera s cities and human population The COG continues to operate out of their capital city of Ephyra and other cities on the plateau such as Jacinto City while the surviving humans known as Stranded are left to wander through Sera s charred ruins The Locust reemerge and begin a campaign of occupying human cities on the Jacinto Plateau to act as stepping stones The Locust are eventually able to emerge and overrun Ephyra years after

deploys the Lightmass Bomb Many of the Locust are killed The Locust Queen Myrrah pledges to continue the war effort In the months following the Lightmass Offensive the human population begins to suffer from a respiratory condition known as Rustlung caused by the inhalation of Imulsion evaporated by the bombings The Locust reemerge and bring with them a force that can sink entire cities on the

sinking Prescott returns to the COG and reveals to Marcus that Adam Fenix is alive After the helicopter crash Adam was rescued and brought to a secret island facility called Azura where he has been working the past seven years on the Imulsion countermeasure a targeted radiation weapon which will neutralize both the Lambent and Locust The island was sieged by Queen Myrrah s remaining forces It is

Horde emerged on the surface of Sera to war against humanity and follows Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago Gameplay Gears of War is a third person shooter game with its core concepts being derived from Resident Evil s over the shoulder perspective Kill Switch s cover system and Bionic Commando s swinging action akin to moving between points of cover The series focuses on using cover to tactically engage the enemy in battle to avoid taking damage While behind cover the player can fire blindly and inaccurately at their opponent or can look around the cover and aim carefully though exposing to enemy fire the player can slide along cover move between nearby cover or vault over cover to race to a new point of cover As the player takes damage the Crimson Omen appears on the HUD becoming more defined as the player nears low health levels The player can regenerate their health by staying out of harm s way for a short while Should the player take too much damage they will become incapacitated unless revived by a teammate depending on game mode the player may be able to recover from this state on their own or may die after a short amount of time if not revived When a combatant is down a member of the other side may attempt to execute the downed player via a curb stomp or other brutal methods Some types of damage will immediately kill the player with no chance of revival such as explosive damage There are five levels on the first two games they are referred to as acts and each act is formed into a certain number of chapters Players in Gears of War can carry four different weapons with the exception of the fourth game allowing two primary weapon slots that can carry weapons which include but are not limited to assault rifles shotguns a sniper rifle grenade launchers and an explosive bow one grenade slot which may be filled with up to four grenades of a specific type Fragmentation Smoke Ink and Incendiary and one pistol type weapon Players can either obtain ammo or swap out their current weapons with any weapon dropped by a downed foe or from those scattered around the various maps Most weapons feature the Active Reload ability either after a weapon has depleted an ammo magazine or when the player starts a manual reload a meter is shown on screen and the player can attempt to stop the meter in a certain marked area If the player stops the meter in the marked area their reload will be completed faster than if they did not attempt an Active Reload and if the player can stop the meter at a specific section of the marked area they will gain a temporary slight damage boost with each reloaded shot and a faster reload If the player stops the meter outside this area their gun will become temporarily jammed and slow down the reload time While most of the weapons are based on standard shooter archetypes Gears of War s signature weapon is the Lancer Assault Rifle which has a mounted chainsaw bayonet that can be used in close quarter combat to instantly kill a standard foe Another notable weapon is the Gnasher Shotgun which is one of the most used weapons in multiplayer modes for the series as well as its most divisive The Gnasher Shotgun like many other weapons can be used to bash opponents in melee or in the case of grenades can be stuck to a foe exploding a few seconds later In Gears of War and Gears of War all four types of grenades can be planted on any reachable surface detonating when an opponent comes close to it If the opponent spots the grenade they can detonate it from a safe distance by shooting it All Gears of War games feature a campaign mode that can be played cooperatively with one other player The two players take the roles of two COG soldiers Marcus Fenix and Dominic Dom Santiago as they fight the Locust In the third game the campaign allows for up to four players to play together at the same time The campaign mode features several levels of difficulty At various times the campaign will offer a choice of paths the first player can select if the second player is present they will be forced to take the other path The third and fourth players in Gears of War will be separated between the paths of the first and second players In these areas all players generally have to work together to get them through the section such as by one player providing covering fire while the second player opens a switch that allows the first player to proceed The competitive multiplayer mode in Gears of War features players while in Gears of War features up to ten players split between COG and Locust forces in a number of gameplay types Modes include Warzone and Execution both similar to a typical deathmatch and Annex and King of the Hill where teams have to control a marked zone on the map In the mode Guardian only in Gears of War one member of each team is designated as the leader As long as the leader is still alive their teammates can respawn indefinitely As soon as the leader is executed their teammates can no longer respawn Games Main series Gears of War Gears of War is a third person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft Studios It was initially released

and release in Cliff Bleszinski the lead designer of the Gears of War video games would serve as executive producer and consultant Wiseman signed on in June with Chris Morgan performing script

story of an alien planet that s living in a horrific environment just feels like the wrong mood right now In April New Line considerably scaled back the million budget and story stalling progress
