The PlayStation PS is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment It was announced as the successor to the PlayStation in April was launched on November in Australia Japan New Zealand North America and South Korea and was released worldwide one week later The PS is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles along with Microsoft s Xbox Series X S consoles which were released in the same month The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu ray discs The Digital Edition lacks this drive as a lower cost model for buying games only through download The two variants were launched simultaneously Slimmer hardware revisions of both models replaced the original models on sale in November The PlayStation s main hardware features include a solid state drive customized for high speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance an AMD GPU capable of K resolution display at up to frames per second hardware accelerated ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections and the Tempest Engine for hardware accelerated D audio effects Other features include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback backward compatibility with the majority of PlayStation and PlayStation VR games and the PlayStation VR headset History Development The lead architect of the PlayStation console line Mark Cerny implemented a two year feedback cycle after the launch of the PlayStation This entailed regularly visiting Sony s first party developers at two year intervals to find out what concerns they had with shortcomings in Sony s current hardware and how such hardware could be improved in console refreshes or for the next generation This feedback directly influenced the priorities of the console development team During the development of the PlayStation a central challenge revolved around addressing the length of loading times for games Cerny said several developers including Epic Games Tim Sweeney told him that standard I O speed of hard disk drives was now a limiting factor in pushing game development Slow data rates placed limits on the size of data being loaded into the game the physical location of data on the storage medium and the duplication of data across the medium in order to reduce load times An important goal was to find ways to reduce loading time particularly in games that stream or dynamically load new game areas as the player moves through the game world Jim Ryan the CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment stated that Sony had researched the feasibility of a low priced reduced spec version of the PlayStation like what Microsoft had done with its lower power counterpart to the Xbox Series X the Xbox Series S and concluded that they believed such consoles do not fare well becoming obsolete too fast Marketing and release Cerny first publicly described the new console in an interview with Wired magazine in April In early Sony s financial report for the quarter ending March affirmed that new next generation hardware was in development but would ship no earlier than April In a second Wired magazine interview in October Sony said it intended to ship its next generation console worldwide by the end of The current hardware specifications were revealed in October At CES Sony unveiled the official logo for the platform which follows the similar minimalist styling of the previous PlayStation consoles and brand Full specifications were given in an online presentation by Cerny and published by Sony and Digital Foundry on March Digital Foundry spoke with Cerny in detail and published a deep dive on April A major game library showcase had been planned for June but was postponed until June due to the George Floyd protests This presentation was also the premiere of the console s external hardware design Sony planned to launch the PlayStation by the end of year holiday period The date and pricing was confirmed as part of a game showcase presentation on September the release date in Australia Japan New Zealand North America and South Korea was confirmed for November and for most of the rest of the world on November PlayStation s release in India was delayed leading to speculation that a trademark dispute was the reason the name PS was briefly trademarked by a different person eventually the dispute was resolved and the system released there on February The console launched in Indonesia on January The system launched in China on May The console launched with two models a base version with an Ultra HD Blu ray compatible optical disc drive for retail game support alongside online distribution via the PlayStation Store and a lower cost variant lacking the disc drive and retaining digital download support Following the September presentation Sony stated that pre orders for the console were to open at various retailers on the following day However several retailers in the United States and the United Kingdom launched pre orders that evening causing a rush on pre orders including scalping as many stores inventories were quickly sold out and creating confusion Sony apologized for the incident on September and promised to increase more pre order deliveries over the coming days and stock through the end of the year Worldwide supply of the console has remained low due to a global chip shortage since Sony expected a short retail stock until In August Sony announced a price increase by up to in most of its markets except the US citing global economic inflationary and supply chain pressures Hardware The PlayStation is powered by a custom system on a chip SoC designed in tandem by AMD and Sony integrating a custom nm AMD Zen CPU with eight cores running at a variable frequency capped at GHz Zen is a bit x instruction set CPU microarchitecture The integrated GPU is also a custom unit based on AMD s RDNA graphics architecture The GPU has compute units running at a variable frequency capped at GHz making it capable of a peak theoretical performance of teraFLOPS The GPU supports hardware accelerated real time ray tracing a rendering technique that allows for realistic lighting and reflections The console has GB of GDDR SDRAM with a peak bandwidth of GB s and integrates Bluetooth and ax Wi Fi Both the CPU and GPU are monitored by a special boost system incorporating AMD s SmartShift technology that adjusts the frequency of these units based on the current activities of both to target ideal constant power drawn and a model SoC performance profile For example if the CPU is running at lower activity the boost system may reduce its frequency and increase the frequency of the GPU for higher performance without otherwise affecting power use or cooling The cooling system includes a double sided cooling fan for air intake that is mm in diameter and mm thick and a large heat sink with a standard heat pipe design that Sony says has a shape and airflow which make it possible to achieve the same performance as a vapor chamber SoC cooling includes a liquid metal thermal conductor which sits between the SoC and the heat sink The system contains a watt power supply Sony developed the PlayStation to consume less energy than the PlayStation for suspended gameplay states The console has a new audio technology called Tempest Engine allowing hundreds of simultaneous sound sources compared to for the PlayStation Storage architecture The internal storage of the PlayStation is a custom built GB solid state drive GB available with a channel interface achieving a raw throughput of GB s This atypical drive size was found to be optimal for the channel pathway rather than a more common GB or TB unit With a dedicated decompression unit supporting zlib and the new Oodle Kraken data compression protocol from RAD Game Tools the unit has a typical throughput of GB s Mark Cerny stated that a fast SSD was the top request from game developers so the goal not only was to have a theoretical raw read speed times faster than PS but to eliminate input output I O bottleneck points so the performance target could be made effective To this end Sony designed a custom chip with multiple coprocessors to work in unison with the flash memory controller to reduce latency and channel data more efficiently around the system At peak the custom unit is capable of processing up to GB s of compressible data Storage for games is expandable up to an additional TB through a single internal NVM Express NVMe M solid state drive and up to an additional TB through an external USB hard drive or SSD Initially at launch NVMe drives were not supported and the console would not boot if one was installed Beta system software support for the M port was released in July while full support was added in a September system update The internal SSD is not user serviceable since its flash memory chips and controller are built into the PlayStation s motherboard Though game installation is mandatory the user has some control of what to install such as only installing the multiplayer component of a game While PlayStation games can be moved between the internal SSD and an external USB or M drive to free up space on the SSD PlayStation games must be stored on the internal SSD or external M drive to be played and at launch could not be moved to an external storage device An April system patch enabled users to move PlayStation games to and from an external USB storage device though the games must still reside on the internal SSD to be played The base version of the PlayStation includes an Ultra HD Blu ray optical drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu ray discs standard Blu ray discs and DVDs The PlayStation does not support CDs and will not play D Blu ray content The choice of Ultra HD Blu ray as the disc medium means PlayStation game discs can hold up to GB of data in contrast to PlayStation games which usually came on dual layer standard Blu ray discs capable of holding up to GB An example of this is the title Gran Turismo The PS version comes on discs whereas the PS version comes on one Form factor The console s form factor was revealed during the June presentation Sony President Jim Ryan stated that the aesthetics are intended to be transformational in how they look sound and feel The launch unit is a two tone design matching the design of the DualSense controller with a black internal block flanked by two white wings along its sides each lit by blue LEDs Ryan stated that more colors than white and black may be available after launch The unit can operate vertically or horizontally Two long air intake vents run along the front and heat exhaust vents dominate the rear The wings are removable to access certain internal components such as the PCIe NVMe SSD storage expansion slot the power supply and the optional Blu ray disc drive Beneath the side panels are two dust catchers holes allowing the user to vacuum out dust collected by the cooling system Senior Art Director Yujin Morisawa led the console s case design inspired by the term five dimensions and crafting the skeleton of its design around circles and squares that would make players comfortable when looking at it Morisawa also had to manage the case shape to provide enough internal volume within the unit for all the technical hardware while reducing its size without restricting airflow The Blu ray version has dimensions of by by millimeters in in in and kilograms lb and the download only version is slightly slimmer at by by millimeters in in in and kilograms lb The console has been recognized for its large size in comparison to previous gaming consoles and its size has been attributed to ensuring effective cooling management and minimizing noise during operation The front includes a USB C port with USB Gen and a USB A port with USB The back has two USB A ports with USB Gen an HDMI port Gigabit Ethernet and power DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers The DualSense wireless controller for the PlayStation was revealed on April It is based on the prior DualShock controller but with modifications influenced by discussions with game designers and players The DualSense controller has adaptive triggers with force feedback through voice coil actuators that can change the resistance to the player as necessary supporting experiences such as virtually drawing an arrow from a bow The DualSense maintains the same buttons as the DualShock though the Share button was renamed to Create with additional means for players to create and share content A new built in microphone array was added so players can speak to others using only the controller and the included controller speaker has been improved It has two tone coloring primarily white with black facing with the black piece being easily detachable The light bar has been moved to the sides of the touchpad It has USB C connectivity a higher rated battery and an audio jack As an Easter egg the texture of the controller unit is covered in miniature versions of the four PlayStation button symbols cross circle square and triangle Sony revealed the DualSense Edge CFI ZCP a new controller for the PlayStation featuring additional capabilities in August The controller features a more modular design than the DualSense with replaceable stick modules multiple control profiles and an option of relocating map inputs The controller was initially released on January on PlayStation Direct but was made available through other retailers on February Hardware revisions Sony began shipping a minor hardware revision of the PlayStation in August The new design the series reduced the size and weight of the heat sink reducing the net system weight by grams lb without having a noticeable effect on cooling performance according to Digital Foundry and Gamers Nexus This design requires no screwdriver for the console stand In August Sony began shipping another hardware revision the series for both the base and digital versions of the PS which used a die shrink of the original SoC This lowered the power draw of the SoC and Sony redesigned the heatsink again contributing to a weight decrease The Digital Edition now weighs kg compared to kg for the launch version and the base version weighs kg compared to kg for the launch version A new version of the PS unofficially referred to as the PlayStation Slim the series was announced by Sony in October for release in November as a replacement for both original versions of the system The two new models are smaller than the original PS include additional USB ports and have TB of internal storage The drive less Digital Edition s cost was increased by USD A disc drive kit can be purchased for USD and installed onto the Digital Edition making it functionally and visually the same as the base model Unlike the original disc model the slim s detachable disc drive requires an internet connection during initial setup Rumors of a mid generation revision to be called the PlayStation Pro began circulating in March Among other improvements the new console would include a GPU about faster than that in the existing PlayStation a deep learning image upscaling technology called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution PSSR and twice as fast ray tracing performance compared to the PlayStation The rumors also stated that Sony s internal studios had been working with the devkit version of the Pro console as early as September and with plans for the console to launch by the end of Additional accessories Accessories include a charging station for the DualSense a new HD camera and a media remote control The Pulse D wireless headset is integrated with the PS s Tempest Engine D audio technology The PS is backwards compatible with most existing PS controllers and accessories for PS games only some with limited functionality Rock Band peripherals are supported since Rock Band PS games can use the existing PlayStation Move PlayStation Camera PlayStation VR Aim Controller officially licensed headsets and specialty controllers with official licenses like flight sticks and racing wheels PlayStation VR Sony announced the PlayStation VR for the PlayStation in January A successor to the PlayStation VR the device consists of a headset featuring dual OLED panels capable of K resolution HDR and Hz refresh rates It also includes two Sense controllers which have embedded IR LEDs for tracking and haptic feedback and adaptive triggers similar to the DualSense controller included with the PlayStation The headset features eye tracking for foveated rendering and in game features in select games Additionally the controllers includes finger touch detection used to render the position of the thumb index and middle fingers to show on in game models Unlike its predecessor it does not require external cameras for it positioning instead it uses four cameras inside the headset to track the headset and controller s position using only the headset s USB C cable to connect to the console The headset launched on February for in the United States in the EU and in the United Kingdom Games available for the PS VR at launch included Horizon Call of the Mountain Gran Turismo and Resident Evil Village The PS VR headset is not compatible with games released for the previous generation PS VR by default requiring developers to update their games The PS VR was released to positive reviews System software The PlayStation s user interface is characterized by Sony as accessible and informative providing updates of friends activities available multiplayer activities and single player missions and rewards Cerny stated we don t want the player to have to boot the game see what s up boot the game see what s up so all of these options are visible in the UI Matt MacLaurin the current vice president of UX design at PlayStation described the redesigned user interface as a very interesting evolution of the OS and a percent overhaul of the PS UI and some very different new concepts MacLaurin stated that the UI is extremely fast with a new and robust visual language Eurogamer said the user interface was conceived for responsiveness improved accessibility clarity and simplicity It is rendered in K resolution and high dynamic range Users are greeted with a stylistic boot up animation and a new login screen The central design concepts and motifs introduced on the PS were redesigned into a new home screen user interface The top of the screen has a row of applications and two upper tabs to switch between showing games or media apps Selecting a game reveals individual activities such as a specific level or multiplayer mode PlayStation Store is no longer a standalone application and is now fully integrated into the home screen user interface The most significant departure from the PS interface is the introduction of the Control Center accessed from the bottom of the screen by pressing the PS button The Control Center is divided into two sections The upper portion is a row of cards suggesting actions based on the current game or recent actions such as a group chat Game related cards may present players with gameplay information such as a progress report toward completing specific missions or listing game challenges with an option to jump directly to them PlayStation Plus subscribers see game activity cards with hints tips screenshots or videos detailing how to complete the activity System level items may present the player with options such as PlayStation Store sale information or recent screenshots taken by the user to be shared These features are available for PS games or for updated PS games The lower portion of the Control Center contains a customizable horizontal row of icons including notifications status updates friends list and system settings According to internal materials reviewed by Vice the strategy behind this activities focused UI was to help players in committing time towards games particularly single player video games which Sony felt were thriving on the PlayStation console environment Sony recognized that at present many players did not have as much time to commit to playing games so the notion of activity cards was used to help give players an idea of what activities they could do in a game and how long it would take so that they could work that activity into their schedule The PlayStation supports multiple streaming services such as Netflix and YouTube with support for others hinted at in the future Sony Pictures Core service was released on the system in The system included support for PlayStation Now Sony s subscription based cloud gaming service while it was available Sony s Remote Play application available on the PlayStation Windows iOS and Android devices was updated just prior to the PlayStation s launch to allow a user to remotely play their PlayStation games on these other devices over a local network Software updates In April Sony released a new software update through which users can transfer their downloaded PS game to an external USB hard drive Sony announced a PlayStation system software beta program in June similar to the Xbox Insider program where signed up users can receive early releases of planned updates to the console s software for testing prior to their release One of the first major features offered in this program was support for expanding internal storage via the M port added in the beta software path in July In September Sony released a new software update offering support for a new trophy tracker Control Center customization D audio support for built in TV speakers internal SSD expansion and several UX enhancements Sony introduced Game Trials in October starting with a limited release for UK users for Death Stranding Director s Cut and Sackboy A Big Adventure Users have access to download and play the full version of the game for a fixed amount of time through these Game Trials after which they would be required to buy the game to continue playing In March Sony released software update which adds several improvements for accessibility such as an improved screen reader with support for features like mono audio reading notifications aloud additional language support and the ability to show a check mark on enabled settings Support for voice commands was also introduced in this update for users in the United States and United Kingdom which allows users to control their PlayStation by saying Hey PlayStation and then a chosen command Support for the Ukrainian language was also added and Game Base was enhanced with the abilities to view all friends in a new Friends tab more easily decline friend requests and other enhancements and updates There were also various enhancements made to trophies child accounts the home screen and other features On March Sony released software update which included VRR support for p resolution the ability to transfer data between PS consoles support for voice chat on Discord and support for using voice to save video clips of gameplay at release this is only available in English for the US and UK On September Sony released software update which included support for Dolby Atmos the possibility to use an M SSD with a maximum capacity of TB up from the previous TB limit and the ability to mute the start up beep sound On March Sony released software update which included the ability to adjust the brightness of the PS s power indicator added new features in Parties and Share Screen and improved the DualSense and DualSense Edge wireless controllers mic input quality with a new AI machine learning model Games Each PlayStation console comes preinstalled with Astro s Playroom a game designed to serve as a demonstration of the DualSense controller Games are not region locked so games purchased in one region can be played on consoles in all regions Sony announced its concurrent responsibilities of supporting the PlayStation community and embracing the PlayStation as a major technological advancement In an interview with GamesIndustry biz Ryan stated We have always said that we believe in generations We believe that when you go to all the trouble of creating a next gen console that it should include features and benefits that the previous generation does not include And that in our view people should make games that can make the most of those features Discussing the capabilities of the DualSense controller with Geoff Keighley General manager Eric Lempel affirmed that Sony want s to evolve every part of the experience but for that to happen we can t take everybody with us from previous consoles into a next generation experience You need new hardware you need new devices to experience what these developers want you to experience Ratchet Clank Rift Apart was highlighted as a next generation game that is not technically possible on older hardware Lempel assured Keighley that interest in PlayStation will not end abruptly with more to come Sony s definition of consoles as distinct generations had been widely interpreted as an era defining shift to PS exclusive games that exploit the console s capabilities instead of releasing cross generation games that play across both PlayStation consoles Ryan said that there should be no disappointment as the PS versions take advantage of the console s advanced feature set and initially planned that PS versions can be freely upgraded Few major games such as Horizon Forbidden West are developed as concurrent releases for PS and PS and Sony supports any publisher that wants to offer enhanced versions of PS games at no additional cost However in May Sony announced a major shift in this approach with previously PS exclusive games Gran Turismo and God of War Ragnar k now planned as both PS and PS games Game journalists believed this was a factor related to the effect of the global semiconductor shortage from the COVID pandemic on PlayStation availability Sony initially had planned to charge PS users to upgrade to the PS version of Horizon Forbidden West when preorders were announced but after negative feedback from consumers who pointed out that Sony had previously mentioned that Horizon Forbidden West would have a free upgrade stated that this upgrade will be free but all future PS to PS upgrades from their first party games will be at cost reversing course from their earlier plans Eurogamer reported that Sony s certification program as of May required PS games submitted for certification after July to be natively compatible with the PlayStation Backward compatibility According to Hideaki Nishino Sony s senior vice president of Platform Planning and Management the PS is designed to be backward compatible with more than percent of PS s game library playable from launch day The console is compatible with PlayStation VR Because of PS s high speed SSD and increased processing power many PS games gain from improved loading times or gameplay speeds so that they can benefit from higher or more stable frame rates and potentially higher resolutions Players can synchronize their saved game files through cloud storage or transfer them using a USB storage device so no progress is lost Backward compatibility is enabled in part by the similarity of hardware architecture such as extra logic in the RDNA GPU that ensures compatibility with PS s GCN based GPU Mark Cerny explained during a March presentation and later in an interview with Digital Foundry how CPU clock timing required particular attention though the Zen CPU has an instruction set to handle the PS s Jaguar CPU their timings can be very different so Sony worked closely with AMD when developing the Zen CPU to more closely match the Jaguar s timings PS backward compatibility may exhibit errors with some PS games and does not include previous generations However some older PlayStation console games are available through the PlayStation Plus game streaming service which is available for the PlayStation The PlayStation s Share menu cannot be displayed but the PS s Create menu can be used to capture screenshots or video All compatible downloaded versions of PS games are visible in the library on the PS and available for download The games can also be copied via USB hard drive or Wi Fi Save data can be copied in the same way or via the cloud storage On October Sony released a list of ten PS games identified as being incompatible with PS the list has shortened since as some developers released compatibility updates for previously incompatible games As of December the official PlayStation website shows six PS games that remain incompatible with PS Afro Samurai Revenge of Kuma Volume One Hitman Go Definitive Edition Just Deal With It Robinson The Journey Shadwen and We Sing Reception The PlayStation was generally well received at launch with much praise of its DualSense controller s improved haptic feedback and adaptive triggers Astro s Playroom which comes preinstalled on every PS and is designed to demonstrate the controller s features was praised with Laptop Mag calling it deceptively cute The exclusive line up including Spider Man Miles Morales and Demon s Souls was heavily praised although some reviewers such as TechRadar said there should have been more launch games The console s user interface was generally praised for being fast and easy to navigate Many reviewers found the console s design polarizing CNET described the black and white scheme as clearly meant to be a sculptural conversation piece The large size was criticized by Tom s Guide as inelegant and by others as frustrating its integration into a home entertainment center Many also acknowledged the size for improving the cooling and quieting of its operation The comparatively small GB of usable SSD space was criticized More technical reviews such as those by Digital Foundry noted that features such as variable refresh rate and the advertised K video output mode were not present at launch They lauded the ray tracing SSD speed and Hz output capabilities Sales The PlayStation as with the Xbox Series X S was in limited supply immediately upon launch and through due to a global semiconductor shortage combined with increased demand for video game consoles due to the COVID pandemic Sony expected supply to continue to be limited until at least Scalpers took advantage of the shortage attempting to sell the console for thousands of dollars Sony expanded its PlayStation Direct program to sell consoles directly to consumers within Europe in November to bypass scalpers Two weeks after launch Sony declared the largest launch in PlayStation history surpassing PS s million units in its first two weeks in During the system s first week of release in Japan standard consoles were sold and Digital Editions were sold for a combined total of making it the best selling console in the country for that week By September Sony reported over one million PS sales in Japan In comparison its predecessor did not reach one million consoles sold until a full year after release In the UK the PlayStation was the best selling video game console sold in the month of November In Spain the PS sold over units in the first week of release Sony reported total shipments of the PS through its fiscal quarter ending December of million units which were similar numbers to the PS s launch shipments Total shipments of PlayStation reached million by March surpassing the million units that the PlayStation had shipped in its first two quarters of release Sony reported that as of July million PS units had been sold through making the PlayStation their fastest selling console unit to date The company later confirmed that by June it had shipped million consoles indicating that nearly every shipped console had been sold as soon as it reached the market Console shipments surpassed million as of September The company anticipated in August it has enough stock hardware to ship more than million PS units by the end of its fiscal year in March but this was revised to million units in November Despite this sales during the fiscal year were forecast to increase to million units Bloomberg News reported in January that Sony was continuing to produce the PlayStation rather than discontinue it at the end of to help alleviate the shortage of the PlayStation while the chip shortage continued Sales of the PlayStation reached million units by May In July it was reported that the PlayStation console had sold over million units worldwide In December it was reported that the PlayStation console had sold over million units worldwide References External links Official website
