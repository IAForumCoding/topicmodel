the first issue Wenner explained that the title of the magazine came from the old saying A rolling stone gathers no moss He also mentioned the blues song Rollin Stone recorded by Muddy Waters the Rolling Stones band and Bob Dylan s hit single Like a Rolling Stone Some authors have attributed the name solely to Dylan s hit single At Ralph Gleason s suggestion Wenner named his magazine after a Bob Dylan song Rolling Stone initially identified with and reported the hippie counterculture of the era You re probably wondering what we re trying to do It s hard to say sort of a magazine and sort of a newspaper The name of it is Rolling Stone which comes from an old saying A rolling stone gathers no moss Muddy Waters used the name for a song he wrote The Rolling Stones took their name from Muddy s song Like a Rolling Stone was the title of Bob Dylan s first rock and roll record We have begun a new publication reflecting what we see are the changes in rock and roll and the changes related to rock and roll However it distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time such as Berkeley Barb embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the underground press In the first edition Wenner wrote that Rolling Stone is not just about the music but about the things and attitudes that music embraces In a article celebrating the publication s th anniversary Rolling Stone s David Browne stated that the magazine s name was a nod to the Rolling Stones in an addition to Rollin Stone and Like a Rolling Stone The magazine s long running slogan All the news that fits was provided by early contributor manager and sometime editor Susan Lydon She lifted it from an April Fools issue of the Columbia Daily Spectator which posted All the news that fits we print a parody of The New York Times slogan All the News That s Fit to Print The first appearance of the rubric was in In the s Rolling Stone began to make a mark with its political coverage with the likes of gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson writing for the magazine s political section Thompson first published his most famous work Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas within the pages of Rolling Stone where he remained a contributing editor until his death in In the s the magazine also helped launch the careers of many prominent authors including Cameron Crowe Lester Bangs Joe Klein Joe Eszterhas Ben Fong Torres Patti Smith and P J O Rourke It was at this point that the magazine ran some of its most famous stories The January issue covered the Altamont Free Concert and the death of Meredith Hunter which won a Specialized Journalism award at the National Magazine Awards in Later in Rolling Stone published a word feature on Charles Manson by David Dalton and David Felton including their interview of Manson when he was in the LA County Jail awaiting trial which won Rolling Stone its first National Magazine Award Four years later they also covered the Patty Hearst abduction odyssey One interviewer speaking for many of his peers said that he bought his first copy of the magazine upon initial arrival on his college campus describing it as a rite of passage In Wenner assigned Tom Wolfe to cover the launch of NASA s last Moon mission Apollo He published a four part series in titled Post Orbital Remorse about the depression that some astronauts experienced after having been in space After the series Wolfe began researching the whole of the space program in what became a seven year project from which he took time to write The Painted Word a book on art and to complete Mauve Gloves Madmen Clutter Vine a collection of shorter pieces and eventually The Right Stuff The magazine began running the photographs of Annie Leibovitz in In she

editor from to and Dave Marsh from Creem In the magazine moved its headquarters from San Francisco to New York City Editor Jann Wenner said San Francisco had become a cultural backwater Change to entertainment magazine Kurt Loder joined Rolling Stone in May and spent nine years there including as editor Timothy White joined as a writer from Crawdaddy and David Fricke from Musician Tom Wolfe wrote to Wenner to propose an idea drawn from Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray to serialize a novel Wenner offered Wolfe around to serialize his work The frequent deadline pressure gave Wolfe the motivation he had sought and from July to August he published a new installment in each biweekly issue of Rolling Stone Later Wolfe was unhappy with his very public first draft and thoroughly revised his work even changing his protagonist Sherman McCoy and published it as The Bonfire of the Vanities in Rolling Stone was known for its musical coverage and for Thompson s political reporting and in they hired an advertising agency to refocus its image under the series Perception Reality comparing Sixties symbols to those of the Eighties which led to an increase in advertising revenue and pages It also shifted to more of an entertainment magazine in the s It still had music as the main topic but began to increase its coverage of celebrities films and pop culture It also began releasing its annual Hot Issue In the s the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth oriented television shows film actors and popular music This led to criticism that the magazine was emphasizing style over substance Expansion of readership After years of declining readership the magazine experienced a major resurgence of interest and relevance with the work of two young journalists in the late s Michael Hastings and Matt Taibbi Rob Sheffield also joined from Spin In Dana Leslie Fields former publisher of Rolling Stone who had worked at the magazine for years was an inaugural inductee into the Magazine Hall of Fame In Taibbi unleashed an acclaimed series of scathing reports on the financial meltdown of the time He famously described Goldman Sachs as a great vampire squid In December the Los Angeles Times reported that the owners of Rolling Stone magazine planned to open a Rolling Stone restaurant in the Hollywood Highland Center

December In the restaurant was open for lunch and dinner as well as a full night club downstairs on the weekends The restaurant closed in February Bigger headlines came at the end of June Rolling Stone caused a controversy in the White House by publishing in the July issue an article by journalist Michael Hastings entitled The Runaway General quoting criticism by General Stanley A McChrystal commander of the International Security Assistance Force and U S Forces Afghanistan commander about Vice President Joe Biden and other Administration members of the White House McChrystal resigned from his position shortly after his statements went public In Taibbi documented illegal and fraudulent actions by banks in the foreclosure courts after traveling to Jacksonville Florida and sitting in on hearings in the courtroom His article Invasion of the Home Snatchers also documented attempts by the judge to intimidate a homeowner fighting foreclosure and the attorney Taibbi accompanied into the court In January the magazine ran exclusive excerpts from Hastings book just prior to publication The book The Operators The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America s War in Afghanistan provided a much more expansive look at McChrystal and the culture of senior American military and how they become embroiled in such wars The book reached Amazon com s bestseller list in the first hours of release and it received generally favorable reviews Salon s Glenn Greenwald described it as superb brave and eye opening In Taibbi through his coverage of the Libor scandal emerged as an expert on that topic which led to media appearances outside Rolling Stone On November the magazine published its first Spanish language section on Latino music and culture in the issue dated November

equivalent to million in on the D hologram cover of the special th issue May displaying multiple celebrities and other personalities Print format The printed format has gone through several changes The first publications in to were in folded tabloid newspaper format with no staples only black ink text and a single color highlight that changed each edition From onwards editions were produced on a four color press with a different newsprint paper size In the bar code appeared In it became a gloss paper large format inch magazine Editions switched to the standard inch magazine size starting with the issue dated October Starting with the new monthly July issue it returned to the previous inch large format Website The publication s site at one time had an extensive message board forum By the late s this had developed into a thriving community with many regular members and contributors worldwide However the site was also plagued with numerous Internet trolls who vandalized the forum substantially The magazine abruptly deleted the forum in May then began a new much more limited message board community on their site in late only to remove it again in In March the website started a new message board section once again then deleted it in April Rolling Stone devotes one of its table of contents pages to promoting material currently appearing on its website listing detailed links to the items On April the website underwent a redesign and began featuring the complete archives of Rolling Stone The archive was first launched under a for pay model but has since transitioned to a free with print subscription model In the spring of Rolling Stone launched a federated search feature which searches both the website and the archive The website has become an interactive source of biographical information on music artists in addition to historical rankings from the magazine Users can cross reference lists and they are also provided with historical insights For example one group that is listed on both Rolling Stone s Greatest Albums of All Time and Rolling Stone s Greatest Songs of All Time is Toots and the Maytals with biographical details from Rolling Stone that explain how Toots and the Maytals coined the term reggae in their song Do the Reggay For biographical information on all artists the website contains a directory listed alphabetically Glixel In May Wenner Media announced plans to create a separate online publication dedicated to the coverage of video games and video game culture Gus Wenner Jann Wenner s son and head of digital for the publication at the time told The New York Times that gaming is today what rock n roll was when Rolling Stone was founded Glixel was originally hosted on Rolling Stone s website and transitioned to its own domain by October Stories from Glixel are included on the Rolling Stone website while writers for Rolling Stone were also able to contribute to Glixel The site was headed by John Davison and its offices were located in San Francisco Rolling Stone closed down the offices in June and fired the entire staff citing the difficulties of working with the remote site from their main New York office Brian Crecente founder of Kotaku and co founder of Polygon was hired as editorial director and runs the site from the main New York office Following the sale of Rolling Stone s assets to Penske Media Corporation the Glixel content was merged into the routine publishing of Variety with Crecente remaining as editorial director Criticism and controversies One major criticism of Rolling Stone involves its generational bias toward the s and s One critic referred to the Rolling Stone list of the Greatest Songs as an example of unrepentant rockist fogeyism In further response to this issue rock critic Jim DeRogatis a former Rolling Stone editor published a thorough critique of the magazine s lists in a book called Kill Your Idols A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics which featured differing opinions from many younger critics Rolling Stone magazine has been criticized for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed and for frequent use of the star rating For example Led Zeppelin was largely written off by Rolling Stone magazine critics during the band s most active years in the s but by a cover story on the band honored them as the Heaviest Band of All Time A critic for Slate magazine described a conference at which s The Rolling Stone Record Guide was scrutinized As he described it The guide virtually ignored hip hop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts In an auditorium packed with music journalists you could detect more than a few anxious titters How many of us will want our record reviews read back to us years hence The hiring of former FHM editor Ed Needham further enraged critics who alleged that Rolling Stone had lost its credibility The Rolling Stone s Greatest Guitarists of all Time article which named only two female musicians resulted in Venus Zine answering with their own list entitled The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time Conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg stated in that Rolling Stone had essentially become the house organ of the Democratic National Committee Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner has made all of his political donations to Democrats Rolling Stone endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run up for the U S presidential election Rolling Stone s film critic Peter Travers has been criticized for his high number of repetitively used blurbs Homosexual HIV story In the article Bug Chasers The men who long to be HIV claimed that homosexuals who intentionally sought to be infected with HIV accounted for of new cases each year However the article s cited physicians later denied making such statements Anti vaccine article In the article Deadly Immunity by anti vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy Jr attracted criticism for quoting material out of context and Rolling Stone eventually amended the story with corrections in response to these and other criticisms Tsarnaev cover The August Rolling Stone cover featuring then accused later convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev drew widespread criticism that the magazine was glamorizing terrorism and that the cover was a slap in the face to the great city of Boston The online edition of the article was accompanied by a short editorial stating that the story falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone s long standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day The controversial cover photograph that was used by Rolling Stone had previously featured on the front page of The New York Times on May In response to the outcry New England based CVS Pharmacy and Tedeschi Food Shops banned their stores from carrying the issue Also refusing to sell the issue were Walgreens Rite Aid and Kmart Roche Bros and Stop Shop H E B and Walmart Eleven Hy Vee Rutter s Farm and United Supermarkets Cumberland Farms and Market Basket and Shaw s Boston mayor Thomas Menino sent a letter to Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner calling the cover ill conceived at best it reaffirms a message that destruction gains fame for killers and their causes Menino also wrote To respond to you in anger is to feed into your obvious market strategy and that Wenner could have written about the survivors or the people who came to help after the bombings instead In conclusion he wrote The survivors of the Boston Marathon deserve Rolling Stone cover stories though I no longer feel that Rolling Stone deserves them Defamatory false rape story and lawsuit In the issue dated November the story A Rape on Campus was run about an alleged gang rape on the campus of the University of Virginia Separate inquiries by Phi Kappa Psi the fraternity accused by Rolling Stone of facilitating the alleged rape and The Washington Post revealed major errors omissions and discrepancies in the story Reporter Sabrina Erdely s story was subject to intense media criticism The Washington Post and Boston Herald issued calls for magazine staff involved in the report to be fired Rolling Stone subsequently issued three apologies for the story On December Rolling Stone s managing editor Will Dana apologized for not fact checking the story Rolling Stone commissioned an outside investigation of the story and its problems by the dean of the Columbia School of Journalism The report uncovered journalistic failure in the UVA story and institutional problems with reporting at Rolling Stone Rolling Stone retracted the story on April On April following the investigation and retraction of the story Phi Kappa Psi announced plans to pursue all available legal action against Rolling Stone including claims of defamation On May UVA associate dean Nicole Eramo chief administrator for handling sexual assault issues at the school filed a million defamation lawsuit in Charlottesville Circuit Court against Rolling Stone and Erdely claiming damage to her reputation and emotional distress Said the filing Rolling Stone and Erdely s highly defamatory and false statements about Dean Eramo were not the result of an innocent mistake They were the result of a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on American college campuses and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic bottom line for its faltering magazine than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts On November after hours of deliberation a jury consisting of eight women and two men found Rolling Stone the magazine s publisher and Erdely liable for defaming Eramo and awarded Eramo million On July three graduates of the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi filed a lawsuit against Rolling Stone its publisher Wenner Media and a journalist for defamation and infliction of emotional distress The same day and just months after the controversy began The New York Times reported that managing editor Will Dana was departing the magazine with his last date recorded as August On November the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity filed suit for million for damages to its reputation caused by the magazine s publication of this story with reckless disregard for the truth Rolling Stone paid the fraternity million to settle the suit out of court Ethics controversy over El Chapo interview In Rolling Stone commissioned Sean Penn to write a feature on Joaqu n El Chapo Guzm n in what was billed as a landmark story and Guzm n s first ever interview Penn met Guzm n then wanted by Mexican and U S authorities at a jungle hideout for an interview the interview agreed to by Guzm n on the condition he have final editorial control over the article Upon publication the article characterized by the Associated Press as long and rambling was extensively mocked by social media users and prompted a discussion about the magazine s ethical standards Andrew Seaman chairman of the ethics committee of the Society of Professional Journalists called the decision to allow a source pre approval of an article inexcusable while the Poynter Institute s chief ethicist Kelly McBride opined that the article evidenced several failures of editorial control by Rolling Stone In an interview with NPR Alfredo Corchado a former Mexico City bureau chief for the Dallas Morning News said that pre approval rights meant the story was not real journalism It s business it s Hollywood It s more in the lines of what a public relations firm would do Questions also arose as to whether lax security procedures by the magazine helped authorities track and capture Guzm n who was arrested several days after the interview was conducted Meanwhile Kate del Castillo who arranged the meeting said that she had to flee the country after the article s publication and charged that Penn had used me as a bait and then he never protected me And risked my life and my parents life and my sister s life and everybody surrounding me Penn later said his article had failed noting that discussion about the ethics of the story overshadowed the actual report False ivermectin story In September Rolling Stone picked up a story published by Oklahoma news outlet KFOR which claimed that so many people had been hospitalized due to ivermectin overdoses in Oklahoma that there was no room in intensive care units for other patients including those with gunshot wounds However an Oklahoma hospital said in a statement that there was no shortage of beds due to ivermectin overdoses and the doctor who had been interviewed by KFOR had not said that ivermectin cases were crowding out other patients but the initial story and subsequent coverage had linked separate comments about ivermectin overdoses and scarce beds CNN fact checker Daniel Dale stated that Rolling Stone had run an adaptation of the KFOR story without appearing to do sufficient research to make sure the local report was sound Rolling Stone subsequently added an editor s note which retracted the core point of its story Kyle Smith of National Review wrote that Rolling Stone s correction is so humiliating it s a wonder the place doesn t shut its doors immediately liquidate all assets and deny that it ever existed Robby Soave of Reason wrote that the correct story was something Rolling Stone could have figured out on its own had the magazine bothered to contact any hospitals in Oklahoma but alas Alex Shephard of The New Republic wrote For mainstream and particularly liberal media this should be a stark reminder of the value of due diligence and checking sources At the very least make a phone call James Gordon Meek child pornography case On January ABC News reporter James Gordon Meek was arrested by the FBI and charged with transporting child pornography Rolling Stone initially broke the story but did not mention the child sexual abuse images that led to the investigation which were known to the reporters instead suggesting that Meek had been targeted by the US government for his reporting on national security issues writing that Meek appears to be on the wrong side of the national security apparatus In the following months it was revealed that Rolling Stone editor Noah Shachtman who personally knows Meek and is considered friendly with him had the story rewritten before publication to exclude all mentions of the child sexual abuse material without the original journalist Tatiana Siegel s knowledge In popular culture George Harrison s song This Guitar Can t Keep from Crying a lyrical sequel to his Beatles track While My
