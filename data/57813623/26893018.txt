Gears of War is a third person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox It is the third installment of the Gears of War series and final game in the original trilogy Originally due for release on April the game was delayed and eventually released on September The story was written by science fiction author Karen Traviss Like its predecessors Gears of War received widespread critical acclaim from critics Critics praised its story voice acting visuals and music but criticized its lack of innovation Gears of War sold over million copies and was the second best selling game in the U S A sequel titled Gears of War developed by The Coalition was released in Gameplay Like its predecessors Gears of War is a third person shooter that emphasizes the use of cover and squad tactics in order to survive combat situations The player s character can carry four weapons one pistol one set of grenades and two primary weapons Firearms can be swapped with other weapons dropped by fallen foes or at stockpiles throughout the game along with ammunition When the player reloads a weapons ammunition they have an opportunity for an active reload shown by a small cursor moving over a line with a marked section on the player s heads up display HUD If the player hits a control button when the cursor is in the marked section they will reload faster with the resulting reload being slightly more powerful than normal bullets causing more damage to opponents as well as allowing for more knockback meaning that enemies running directly at you will be slowed on shot If they press the button outside this section this temporarily jams the weapon leaving the player vulnerable and taking longer to reload Alternatively the player can opt to not try for the active reload reloading the weapon at normal speed but with no added damage When in combat the player can take some damage from enemy fire filling a blood colored crimson omen on the HUD as a measure of the player s health unlike the traditional health bar in other shooters By staying out of the line of fire this will dissipate over time but by taking too much damage the player will become downed or killed and must be revived by an ally within a short bleed out period or else the player will die unless playing the game on Insane difficulty in which case a player will die immediately after taking too much damage without the bleed out The player can also be killed during the bleed out by the use of the game s signature execution moves by the enemy Some types of damage such as explosives or head shots can kill the player immediately without the bleed out period Similarly the player can also cause enemies to fall into bleed out in the same manner The player and their allies and enemies can use nearly any structure as cover firing blind from behind it or leaning out to take aimed shots while usually exposing their head more Players can quickly switch between nearby covering walls or jump over lower cover to rush forward Within Gears of War some cover can be destroyed after taking some amount of damage which can be used to a tactical advantage to draw out enemies from cover New to Gears of War is the ability to tag enemy opponents computer controlled allies will then concentrate fire on these marked enemies while human allies will be alerted to their location on their HUD Players can now also swap weapons and ammunition and money during Horde Mode with other allies in the course of battle The player maintains an experience level that persists across all game modes The player earns experience through kills performing special types of kills and executions reviving and aiding teammates and through general process of the campaign or competitive modes Players can also gain experience points by winning medals and ribbons which are awarded for defeating enemies with certain weapons or winning several matches Earning levels unlocks the use of special characters and weapon skins within the game s multiplayer mode Synopsis Setting Gears of War takes place two years after Jacinto humanity s last stronghold is destroyed in an effort to completely
