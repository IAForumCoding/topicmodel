requirements Warwick Tuck head of Immigration New Zealand said that Dotcom had been granted residency as an investor plus or someone who invested million in New Zealand Despite granting him residency Immigration New Zealand expressed concern that their decision might attract criticism that they had allowed Dotcom to buy his way into the country and attempted to keep it secret Dotcom s residency status subsequently became the subject of intense media speculation when it came to light that Auckland mayor John Banks had become involved and that New Zealand s intelligence services had spied on him an act made illegal by Dotcom s possession of residency in New Zealand Immigration New Zealand officers judged Dotcom s convictions in Hong Kong to be too minor to consider deporting him On his residency application of June Dotcom erroneously denied having been convicted of dangerous driving he had pled guilty to dangerous driving north of Auckland in September The media speculated at the time that this could provide grounds for deportation Involvement with Auckland mayor John Banks John Banks met Dotcom when Banks was Mayor of Auckland City He asked Dotcom for help putting on a fireworks display in the city s harbour Banks later attended a New Year s Eve party thrown by Dotcom at the city centre apartment of now bankrupt property developer David Henderson He said it provided a great view of the fireworks display detonated over the Waitemat Harbour Banks said he had advised Dotcom on how to obtain permission from the Overseas Investment Office to buy the Coatesville mansion On April Dotcom revealed he had donated to John Banks mayoral campaign in and that Banks had asked him to split the donation in two allowing the Banks campaign to claim them as anonymous by falling within the anonymous limit of In Banks was found guilty of filing a false electoral return with evidence from Dotcom playing a major part in the case This conviction was subsequently overturned on appeal following the discovery of new evidence and a planned retrial was later cancelled and a verdict of acquittal entered Among Dotcom s revelations was a phone call from Banks thanking him for the contribution Dotcom subsequently recorded a song titled Amnesia which mocks John Banks and the controversy of Dotcom s donation to him A poll in October found the New Zealand public had a more favourable view of Kim Dotcom than of Banks Megaupload arrest and extradition proceedings In February Dotcom set up Data Protect Limited but changed the name to Megaupload in He was the chief executive officer Megaupload was an online file hosting and sharing service in which users could share links to files for viewing or editing much of it pirated Eventually it had over employees US million revenues and million daily visitors At its peak Megaupload was estimated to be the th most popular site on the Internet and responsible for of all Internet traffic On January indictments were filed in Virginia in the United States against Dotcom and other company executives with crimes including racketeering conspiring to commit copyright infringement and conspiring to commit money laundering Two weeks later January Kim Dotcom Finn Batato Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk were arrested in Coatesville New Zealand by New Zealand Police in an armed raid on Dotcom s house involving officers and two helicopters Seized assets included eighteen luxury cars large TVs works of art and US million in cash Dotcom s bank accounts were frozen denying him access to bank accounts world wide including BNZ and Kiwibank accounts in New Zealand government bonds and money from numerous PayPal accounts Dotcom was remanded to Mt Eden Prison and alleged poor treatment by the authorities On February North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned previous rulings and released Dotcom on bail reasoning that Dotcom had neither the ability nor desire to flee the country High Court On June High Court of New Zealand Justice Helen Winkelmann found that the warrants used to seize Dotcom s property were illegal because they were too broad The Crown later admitted that it was aware that it was using the wrong order while the raid was in progress and that Dotcom should have been given the chance to challenge the seizure It also admitted to giving seized hard drives to the FBI who made copies of them in New Zealand and then sent them back to the US Justice Winkelmann ruled that the handing of hard drives seized by New Zealand police in the raid to the FBI and the copying of data on them by the FBI was illegal As a result of those rulings Justice Judith Potter allowed Dotcom to withdraw approximately NZ million US million on August of his seized assets and to sell nine of his cars The amount released was to cover million in existing legal bills million in future costs and another million in rent on his New Zealand mansion Court of Appeal In May a district court judge ruled that the FBI should hand over all its evidence against Dotcom relating to the extradition bid The Crown appealed but the ruling was upheld by the High Court The Crown appealed again and in March the Court of Appeal quashed the previous court decisions Crown lawyer John Pike on behalf of the US Government argued that the district court had no power to make disclosure decisions in an extradition case and that disclosure was extensive and could involve billions of emails The Court of Appeal agreed stating that extradition hearings were not trials and the full protections and procedures for criminal trials did not apply Dotcom s lawyer Paul Davison QC appealed to the Supreme Court In May the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case so it will make the final decision on whether Dotcom should receive all the FBI investigation files before the extradition hearing A series of subsequent court decisions delayed every attempt to hold a hearing focused on extradition In March Dotcom won a Court of Appeal ruling allowing him to sue the GCSB rejecting the attorney s general appeal against a ruling in December A month later Dotcom appeared in court again seeking compensation from police over the raid on his house which earlier had been deemed illegal Confidential settlement with police In November Dotcom and his former wife Mona accepted a confidential settlement from the police over the raid The settlement came after a damages claim was filed with the High Court over the unreasonable use of force when the anti terrorism Special Tactics Group raided his mansion in January Settlements have already been reached between police and Bram van der Kolk and Mathias Ortmann who were also arrested The New Zealand Herald reported that their settlements were six figure sums and it is likely Dotcom would seek more as the main target in the raid Commenting on the settlement Dotcom said We were shocked at the uncharacteristic handling of my arrest for a non violent Internet copyright infringement charge brought by the United States which is not even a crime in New Zealand Supreme Court In February the New Zealand Court of Appeal deemed the raids on Kim Dotcom to be legal but not the FBI s taking of information Dotcom appealed this decision to the Supreme Court In December four of the five judges agreed with the Court of Appeal that the raid was legal and ordered Dotcom to pay costs Chief Justice Sian Elias dissented saying there had been a miscarriage of justice as the search warrant was too broad A month before the Supreme Court decision Dotcom s legal team quit after he had spent million on his defence financed the Internet Party then run out of money When the US tried to have his bail revoked a new lawyer Ron Mansfield helped keep him out of prison In December events took another turn when the High Court in Hong Kong ruled that the United States did not have a clear path to serve a legal summons on Dotcom s filesharing company and he could take a case to get back million seized by authorities there In making this decision Judge Tallentire said No one can say when that process of extradition will be completed given the appeal paths open to the various accused Indeed no one can say if it will ever be completed Political fallout After his arrest by the New Zealand police in January Dotcom had an ongoing dispute with Prime Minister John Key about when Key had first become aware of Dotcom Dotcom argued that Key had been involved in a plan to allow him into New Zealand so that he could then be extradited to the US to face copyright charges Key had consistently said he had never heard of Dotcom until the day before the New Zealand police raid on his mansion in Coatesville Apology for illegal spying on Dotcom On September Key revealed that at the request of the police the New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau GCSB had spied on Dotcom to help police locate him and monitor his communications in the weeks prior to the raid on his house The GCSB are not allowed to spy on New Zealand citizens or permanent residents Dotcom though not a citizen had been granted permanent residency Three days later Key apologized for the illegal spying Application for damages In December Chief High Court judge Helen Winkelmann ordered the GCSB to confirm all entities to which it gave information This also allowed Dotcom to sue the Crown for damages The Crown appealed Justice Winkelmann s decision but in March the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court s decision Dotcom was unable to access the information but Stuart Grieve QC who was appointed as a Special Advocate was given access Dotcom argued in the Court of Appeal that there had been judicial miscarriage but the court ruled in favour of the GCSB Dotcom next sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court but in February it rejected his appeal and ordered him to pay the GCSB NZ Media reaction The mistakes by authorities attracted widespread media coverage and Key s handling of the affair was criticised by opposition parties in Parliament Political commentator Bryce Edwards criticised the GCSB s involvement and described the prosecution of Dotcom as the stuff of farce The Sunday Star Times commentator Richard Boock compared the Dotcom saga to Watergate and suggested it might eventually bring down John Key The story made headlines overseas including in the Wall Street Journal New York Times The Guardian and the Hollywood Reporter which specialises in legal and entertainment issues On US involvement in his arrest Dotcom claimed to be a legitimate businessman who has been persecuted by the United States government and industry trade groups such as the RIAA and Motion Picture Association of America MPAA He blames former US President Barack Obama for colluding with Hollywood to orchestrate his arrest and has spoken out against his negative portrayal in the media In regard to the illegal spying conducted by GCSB Dotcom said they were not spying to find out where he was In May Dotcom released a page white paper alleging that the US government persecuted him at the behest of Hollywood in exchange for support for Obama Speculation about Hollywood s role in Dotcom s arrest grew when in September Key made a four day visit to meet top studio executives Key said the trip was intended to promote New Zealand as a good country to produce films but he was planning to meet with the MPAA which had described Dotcom as a career criminal In November The New Zealand Herald journalist David Fisher published The Secret Life of Kim Dotcom Spies Lies and the War for the Internet Internet Party In September Dotcom revealed he aspired to enter New Zealand politics On March Dotcom founded the Internet Party In May it was announced that the Internet Party would form a political alliance with the Mana Party led by local activist and sitting Member of Parliament Hone Harawira The deal was brokered to serve the Mana Party financially with the combined structure s political campaign in the general election being primarily funded by Dotcom In contrast the fledgling Internet Party was to benefit from the possibility of seats in parliament in the event that the combined structure were to achieve a greater percentage of the country s vote helped along by the Mana Party s existing seat Due to his citizenship status Dotcom was ineligible to become a member of parliament and Laila Harr a veteran of left wing politics and trade unions was chosen as leader of the Internet Party The Moment of Truth On September Dotcom held an event in the Auckland Town Hall five days before the election in which he promised to provide absolute proof that Prime Minister John Key knew about him long before he was arrested The event was billed as the Moment of Truth and included the release of what was claimed to be an email dated October from Kevin Tsujihara the chief executive of Warner Bros to a senior executive at the Motion Picture Association of America the lobby group for the Hollywood studios The New Zealand Herald which broke the story contacted Warner Bros who said the email was a fake In the general election the joint Internet Party and Mana Movement gained of the nationwide party vote but failed to win any seats Dotcom who was not a candidate because he is not a New Zealand citizen sank NZ million into the Internet Party the largest personal contribution to a political party on record in New Zealand according to the national Electoral Commission I take full responsibility for this loss tonight Dotcom told reporters as election results became clear because the brand the brand Kim Dotcom was poison for what we were trying to achieve The Serious Fraud Office investigated the email and determined that it was a forgery The media criticised Dotcom for failing to deliver at the Moment of Truth after saying for three years that he could prove John Key had lied in relation to his copyright case After the election in which the Internet Mana alliance failed to win a seat public support for Dotcom seemed to dissipate Dotcom said in January he had become such a pariah in New Zealand that he might as well leave the country general election The party remained leaderless until February when Suzie Dawson was appointed as its new leader for the general election The Mana connection was dropped and the party contended as the single entity the Internet Party The Internet Party ran party list candidates The party won only votes and failed to win any seats in the New Zealand House of Representatives The Internet Party was deregistered on June because its membership had dropped below the required for registration Extradition District court After three years legal wrangling involving two supreme court cases and separate delays in the proceedings extradition proceedings finally got underway in an Auckland court on September The wrangling continued at the hearing with Dotcom and his colleagues saying that they were unable to present a proper defence because the US had threatened to seize any funds they try to spend on international experts in Internet copyright issues Dotcom s American lawyer Ira Rothken said they would need about US to get evidence from the appropriate experts Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig an international expert in copyright and fair use provided his written opinion for free He said there were no legal grounds to extradite Dotcom and the allegations and evidence made public by the US Department of Justice do not meet the requirements necessary to support a prima facie case that would be recognised by United States federal law Once the hearing finally got under way Crown prosecutor Christine Gordon on behalf of the US Government called it a simple scheme of fraud Defence Lawyer Ron Mansfield s page submission began with the argument that the case should be thrown out because the United States Supreme Court ruled in a parallel case in that copyright infringement was a civil matter and could not be prosecuted as criminal fraud The Crown also made numerous references to intercepted Skype conversations between Dotcom and his co defendants Christine Gordon said one message written by Dotcom when translated from German read At some point a judge will be convinced about how evil we are and then we are in trouble Mr Mansfield said this sentence was used repeatedly by Ms Gordon during her submission with the knowledge that it would make international media headlines Mansfield had the passage translated by three independent academics who said it had a very different meaning and should read At some stage a judge will be talked into how bad we allegedly are and then it will be a mess On December North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson announced that Dotcom and the three other Megaupload co founders were eligible for extradition He said the US had a large body of evidence which supported a prima facie case An immediate appeal was lodged by Dotcom s lawyer High Court In February the New Zealand High Court upheld the earlier decision of the district court that Dotcom and his three co accused could be extradited to the United States However Justice Murray Gilbert accepted the argument made by Dotcom s legal team that he and his former Megaupload colleagues cannot be extradited because of copyright infringement The judge said he made this decision because online communication of copyright protected works to the public is not a criminal offence in New Zealand However Justice Gilbert said there were general criminal law fraud provisions in New Zealand law which covered the actions of the accused and they could be extradited on that basis Dotcom saw this decision as a major victory saying The major part of this litigation has been won by this judgement that copyright is not extraditable The ruling opened the door to further appeals because the warrant which was served on him when he was arrested on January stated he was being charged specifically with copyright offences Both sides are expected to challenge aspects of the ruling before the New Zealand Court of Appeal and eventually the Supreme Court Court of Appeal On July the New Zealand Court of Appeal upheld the High Court s decision that Dotcom and the three co accused could be extradited to the United States In particular the Court disagreeing with Justice Gilbert found that even during the time of Megaupload s operations it is a criminal offence in New Zealand to possess digital copyrighted works with an intention to disseminate them Accordingly Dotcom and his co accused could be extradited on the basis of copyright infringement to stand trial in the United States Dotcom s lawyer said that he would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court In June Dotcom began a final appeal to halt his extradition from New Zealand to the US Supreme Court On November the Supreme Court of New Zealand ruled that Dotcom could be extradited to the United States to face criminal copyright related charges However the Supreme Court also ruled that he and three other co defendants could challenge the decision through a judicial review In addition the Supreme Court ruled that the High Court and Court of Appeal had been wrong not to consider their application for a judicial review of the original district court decision in that had first ruled in favour of extradition Dotcom s lawyer Ron Mansfield described the judgment as a mixed bag stating that the Supreme Court had accepted there were serious procedural issues while warning that the Court s rejection of Megaupload s safe harbour defence would have an immediate and chilling impact on the Internet The two executives charged for operating Megaupload along with Dotcom namely Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk agreed to a plea bargain with New Zealand and US prosecutors that June and were sentenced to two years seven months and two years six months in a New Zealand prison respectively on June leaving Dotcom as the only party still defending his innocence in the case The ultimate fate of Dotcom s extradition is yet to be determined with analysts predicting his extradition case could continue without a final judgment for a further three to five years on from Seth Rich conspiracy theory In late May Dotcom posted statements on Twitter and his website claiming he worked with Seth Rich on the Internet Party and had proof that Rich was the source of the Democratic National Committee email leak In tweets Dotcom claimed to be involved with Seth Rich as WikiLeaks source Dotcom said he was willing to provide written testimony to the US Congress and that he was willing to provide evidence to US special counsel Robert Mueller if his safe passage from New Zealand to the United States was guaranteed Seth Rich s family issued a statement calling Dotcom s statements ridiculous manipulative and non credible and their spokesman Brad Bauman tweeted to Dotcom that you have an agenda or are a sociopath Dotcom tweeted an alleged FBI file about Seth Rich warning that it might be fake He later agreed it was fake but said there was no need to delete the tweet since he had issued a warning soon after posting it that the file could be fake Seth Rich s Gmail account received an emailed invitation from Mega a file sharing service started by Dotcom following the seizure of Megaupload but for which he had not worked for years According to experts and Rich s family the emailed invitation from welcome mega nz appeared to be an attempt to access Rich s email David Weigel of The Washington Post wrote that Rich s family worried that Dotcom or someone eager to prove him right may have been willing to create a fake archive of emails from Rich or crack a password to see whether Rich had passed on documents with a Mega account Support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine During the Russo Ukrainian War Dotcom has repeatedly spread anti Ukrainian falsehoods as well as far right and Russian government propaganda He was spreading fake information about Ukraine from Russian propaganda about Nazism the Russian speaking minority American biolaboratories accusing the USA of being responsible for the war Other activities Following the September attacks in the United States Dotcom launched a group called Young Intelligent Hackers Against Terrorism YIHAT He said that he had hacked Sudanese bank accounts belonging to Osama Bin Laden and offered a million reward for information leading to Osama s capture on his now defunct kimble org site Dotcom participated in a mock funeral procession for public broadcaster TVNZ in downtown Auckland on the day of its final broadcast He had warmed to one of its more notable shows Media for its championing of Internet freedom and had been interviewed on the show at least once In February Lindsey Stirling released Lord of The Rings Medley a music video funded by Dotcom In June Dotcom announced the upcoming launch of Megabox a music streaming service That October he said that Megabox would launch on January the first anniversary of Megaupload s shutdown In August Dotcom teased an upcoming album with the release of a song titled Party Amplifier Dotcom was already in the process of recording the album with friend and producer Printz Board who wrote Yes We Can for Barack Obama s election campaign when he was arrested Printz and Dotcom recorded more than songs at Neil Finn s Roundhead Studios in Newton Auckland one of which is called Mr President an electronica protest song against Barack Obama On November Dotcom announced a new file storage service similar to Megaupload using the domain name me ga It was to be launched January but the African state of Gabon which controls the ga domain cancelled the me ga name on November The site has since registered the names mega co nz and mega net nz The new file hosting service offers file encryption to enhance user privacy and security As a result of this encryption Dotcom and mega co nz will not know of the content of the uploaded data allowing for the claim of plausible deniability to be made should new charges arise In January Dotcom offered a reward to anyone able to defeat the site s security system Dotcom has been involved in the local community in Auckland In December he announced that he would be playing the part of Santa Claus in the play MegaChristmas run by Auckland s Basement Theatre In a local ceremony on the first of that
