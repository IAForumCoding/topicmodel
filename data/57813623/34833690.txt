attracted an to year old demographic He also saw games to be an expanding market in consideration of mobile and social network game categories Forbes described Bankoff s offer as a serious commitment to online journalism in an age of content farms and disappearing print publications but Grant did not trust the offer and declined Upon seeing the effort that Vox Media put into The Verge their Chorus content management system and the quality of their content and sponsorships Grant changed his mind and returned to pitch Bankoff Grant wanted the new site to compete with top gaming websites GameSpot and IGN but still be able to run longform magazine style journalism that could be of historic interest As part of the site s attempt to redefine games journalism Vox Media made a part documentary

apart from other games journalism outlets by focusing on the people making and playing the games rather than the games alone At the site s outset Polygon planned to run multiple longform feature articles weekly which they intended to be comparable in intent to the cover stories of magazines They also decided to allow their game review scores to be updated as the games were updated so as to more adequately reflect games that had changed with downloadable content and updates since their original release In consideration of games that may differ in quality before and after release Polygon later began to mark pre release reviews as provisional to defer final scoring until after their public release Polygon s emphasis on video production expanded in late and waned in mid with the loss of
